The next thing they knew, they had been arrested on charges that were never made clear to them. Ms. Schonemann spent a year as a political prisoner, then was put directly on a bus for the West. Her husband, who received a slightly longer sentence, and their two children were sent after her, with only a few suitcases of belongings.</p> <p>""Locked-Up Time,"" Ms. Schonemann's extraordinary documentary about that experience, begins with another bus on the highway, but this time the director is traveling in the opposite direction. In 1990, after the Berlin Wall had come down, she returned to the East. She says she wanted to confront the past, but the film is more remarkable for the way Ms. Schonemann confronts the individuals responsible for her arrest and imprisonment. This deft and chilling film has the style of a personal excursion into history and the urgency of a moment when history is still inchoate.

They said the ring also used the method of having human carriers swallow heroin-filled pellets.</p> <p>Most of the heroin on the East Coast comes from Colombia, according to the investigators, with much of it going through New York City before reaching other cities.</p>",1770877,30 Are Arrested in Breakup of Major Heroin Smuggling Ring,,42,0,,362,Identify incidents of human smuggling.,human smuggling

On Tuesday, Michael Howard, the Conservative leader, urged Britons to choose ''a better way'' because Mr. Blair's government had ''lost the plot.''</p> <p>May 5 had long been talked about as the most likely day for a contest that will be fought over issues ranging from the war in Iraq to the economy and public services, particularly education, police action against crime and the services offered by the National Health Service.</p> <p>''Our mission will be driven by values,'' Mr. Blair declared after visiting Buckingham Palace to seek Queen Elizabeth II's agreement to dissolve Parliament -- a ceremonial step opening what is sure to be a fierce campaign.</p> <p>A central argument for Mr. Blair is likely to be that Labor has managed the British economy well and still has work to do. ''This is the time to keep the progress going, move the country forward,'' he said in Dorset in southwest England in his first campaign appearance.</p> <p>Many political analysts in Britain have argued that Mr. Blair is virtually assured of victory because it would take an enormous swing toward the Conservatives to wipe out his commanding majority of around 160 seats in the 646-seat Parliament.</p> <p>But opinion surveys published in three newspapers on Tuesday showed Labor leading by only two to three percentage points, while a fourth poll based on the views of people who say they are certain of voting actually gave the Conservatives a 5-point lead.</p> <p>Since the British electoral system favors Labor's urban power base, even a margin of that magnitude would not translate into a Conservative majority at the polls. But if Mr. Blair's majority is seriously eroded, he could be viewed as a lame duck leader -- particularly because he has said he will not seek a fourth term.

Photographs show men and women with swollen lash marks across their backs and chests. Opposition leaders report that more than 1,000 people have fled their homes and that more than 500 people have been arrested.</p> <p>The police confirmed that they had arrested hundreds, adding that those detained had incited violence. Some of them, the police said, burned buses and cars. The police officials denied accusations of brutality.</p> <p>Human rights groups, however, say most of those arrested are leaders and supporters of Zimbabwe's main opposition party, the Movement for Democratic Change. The prisoners, human rights officials say, are often beaten and detained in their homes.</p> <p>The deepening tensions followed a two-day strike by the opposition that halted most business and industry in Zimbabwe. The action was considered the largest public protest against Mr. Mugabe, 79, since he was re-elected last year in a contest that was marred by charges of fraud and intimidation.</p> <p>Political analysts and opposition leaders issued forecasts for more political storms ahead. In a speech last Friday, Mr. Mugabe boasted that he could be a ''black Hitler, tenfold.''</p> <p>The State Department has called on the Zimbabwe government to ''cease its campaign of violent repression,'' and to bring to justice the perpetrators of ''serious and widespread human rights abuses.''</p> <p>South African leaders, long advocates of what they call ''quiet diplomacy'' with Zimbabwe, began on Wednesday to turn up the volume, with expressions of concern by President Thabo Mbeki of South Africa to Parliament.

That would, by extension, include the kind of cooperation necessary for European integration to succeed.</p> <p>Mr. Blair's spokesman, Alastair Campbell, gave advance details of the speech as part of an effort by the Blair government to soften British opposition to the euro in a country where opinion surveys show that more than two thirds of people still oppose the project.</p> <p>But Mr. Blair is expected to say  that the history of Britain's postwar relationship with continental Europe has been one of missed opportunities, caused by the timidity of politicians fearful of an anti-European backlash among their own voters.</p> <p>In effect, Mr. Blair is hoping that the impetus and lessons of his diplomacy as America's junior partner in the war in Afghanistan will carry over to his pro-European agenda.  But such are the sensitivities in Britain about the European Union that the speech will not mark the beginning of a headlong British rush into membership of the euro, Mr. Campbell said. And British officials were careful today to reject the idea that the speech will mark the beginning of a campaign by Mr. Blair to press for a referendum on the issue.</p> <p>''What he's not saying is that you join the single currency come what may,'' Mr. Campbell said. ''What he's saying is that we must take decisions in our own national interest and our interest is in being a strong player in Europe.''</p> <p>All but Britain, Sweden and Denmark among the European Union's 15 members subscribe to the single currency, which came into being in electronic transactions on Jan. 1, 1999, but which will become legal tender in most of Western Europe's stores, supermarkets, pocketbooks and pay packets on Jan. 1, 2002.</p> <p>Britain has declined to join since the single currency was first mooted almost a decade ago and the issue has become one of the most divisive. It has sparked a bitter feud between Mr. Blair and Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown, which Mr. Brown sought to play down in a published interview today, calling Mr. Blair ''the best friend I've had in politics.''</p> <p>Mr. Blair has promised to decide before the summer of 2003 whether to call a plebiscite on euro membership and, Mr. Campbell reiterated today, that decision will depend on whether participation in the single currency will benefit the British economy.</p> <p>In reality, most analysts see the decision as political, likely to be swayed by considerations of whether a referendum can be won.

Requirements for Business</p> <p>The law, which applies to companies with 15 or more employees in San Francisco, requires that workers be provided with adjustable chairs, proper lighting and terminals with adjustable screens and detached keyboards.</p> <p>It also requires that workers without regularly scheduled rest breaks be given 15 minutes of alternative work, if available, after every two hours of work at a terminal.</p> <p>Mayor Agnos said Monday that he would sign the ordinance after business and labor leaders agreed to support amendments that would give businesses four years, instead of two, to comply fully with the law.</p> <p>Under the amendments, the two-year deadline for compliance now required by the law would be replaced with a three-stage process.</p> <p>Starting in a year any new equipment bought would have to comply with the ordinance.

Millions of supports, also known as wrist managers, have been sold. More than a million of the Pro Flex model alone have been sold since 1989, including half amillion this year. The company expects to sell a half million more in 1993. WHY: In 1990 the Bureau of Labor Statistics estimated that of the 46 million Americans using computer keyboards, more than 180,000 suffered from wrist or hand injuries linked to repetitive tasks like typing. The most serious repetitive stress injury, or R.S.I., is carpal tunnel syndrome, a swelling of nerves where they pass through the wrists. That can cause crippling pain, weakness, numbness or tingling in the hands or wrists. Less troubling injuries include a variety of inflammation and swelling problems.</p> <p>WHO NEEDS IT?: You, possibly. In this age of the ubiquitous computer keyboard, the average data-entry office worker will flex his wrists about 5,000 times a day. ""They have become occupational athletes,"" said Paula Newman, a spokeswoman for Ergodyne. WHO ELSE?: Actual athletes, like bowlers, bicyclists, tennis players, golfers and softball players, as well as workers involved in tasks like meat-cutting, operating a cash register, dealing cards or working on an assembly line. ""Basically, anyone who is involved with picking, packing or plucking,"" Ms. Newman said. HOW IT WORKS: Wraps around the wrist with Velcro-like fasteners (Ergodyne's name for hook and loop fasteners is Aplix) and across the palm between the thumb and index finger. The device is designed to keep the wrist straight without immobilizing it. Most older wrist supports contained hard plastic splints and sometimes laced up the forearm like a corset. The Pro Flex has flexible steel stays encased in two synthetic materials, Vinaguard and Ultrilure, that give it as much support as a hard wrist support but increased movement and comfort. WHERE TO BUY IT: See the ergonomic experts where you work. Most Pro Flex supports are sold to them in bulk by safety equipment distributors, but they are also available in some hardware stores and home centers under the Safety Maid label. Average cost: $20. FASHION FACTS: Sizes range from X-Small to X-Large, but there are only two color schemes: tan with navy or black with silver. There are no plans for pastel, fluorescent or leather models, although there have been requests. Ergodyne can customize its wrist supports with logos, company colors, reflective tape or employee numbers.

The Pro Flex has flexible steel stays encased in two synthetic materials, Vinaguard and Ultrilure, that give it as much support as a hard wrist support but increased movement and comfort. WHERE TO BUY IT: See the ergonomic experts where you work. Most Pro Flex supports are sold to them in bulk by safety equipment distributors, but they are also available in some hardware stores and home centers under the Safety Maid label. Average cost: $20. FASHION FACTS: Sizes range from X-Small to X-Large, but there are only two color schemes: tan with navy or black with silver. There are no plans for pastel, fluorescent or leather models, although there have been requests.

Bonsal, a career diplomat and the last United States Ambassador to Cuba, died Wednesday in his home here. He was 92.</p> <p>He had been under treatment for pneumonia.</p> <p>When Mr. Bonzal arrived in Havana in February 1959 as Ambassador, relations between the United States and the revolutionary Castro Government had already begun to deteriorate. But stepping off the plane, Mr. Bonsal shook hands with a bearded Castro emissary and congratulated him on the bravery of the revolutionaries who had overthrown the dictatorship of Fulgencio Batista, which had been backed by Washington for many years.</p> <p>The act was widely noted in the Cuban press, and Prime Minister Fidel Castro, later the Cuban President, expressed appreciation for his ""friendly, cordial"" approach.</p> <p>Despite this auspicious beginning, Mr. Bonsal was unable to develop a dialogue with the revolutionary, and as nationalization of American-owned companies proceeded, his counsel of quiet negotiation was largely ignored in Washington.</p> <p>Without notifying him, the Eisenhower Administration suspended Cuba's sugar import quota -- three million tons -- in July 1960, in response to Havana's sale of a million tons of sugar to the Soviet Union. Mr. Bonsal opposed this and other economic sanctions against Mr. Castro as likely to drive him further into the Soviet orbit.</p> <p>He was recalled to Washington in October 1960 in retaliation for a Cuban demand that the United States Embassy staff in Havana be sharply reduced. He never returned.

Quite the contrary, those summers gave me the wherewithal to grab a low spot on the totem pole of bourgeois life, a spot to which I have clung desperately ever since.</p> <p>No, I think of the guillotine because those summers and the years that followed taught me something about the changing nature of income inequality and class resentment. Back in 1978, when I made off with an Ivy League diploma, my first job paid less than I had been making opening doors and helping old ladies with their packages. Worse yet, it took me four years of full-time work before my white-collar wages exceeded what I would have earned in uniform back on East 69th Street. Even at that point, however, I was still in the hole. Think of all those semesters of forgone earnings. Think of the tuition, room, board and bookstore expenses. And think about the cost of all that capital.</p> <p>I have to acknowledge that in those days, I resented the wages of Teamsters and sanitation workers almost as much as I did hereditary wealth. Much has been written lately about the enormous earnings advantage conferred by a college education, but what's striking to me is that this advantage was once so scant. Thirty years ago, in fact, the economist Richard Freeman published a book called ''The Over-educated American,'' and although I was too young and stupid to realize it, I was one.</p> <p>It's true that I chose a line of work -- newspapers -- that is notorious for low entry-level wages, but the broader data bear me out. In 1978, men with a bachelor's degree had an estimated wage premium of just 21 percent over men who were high school graduates, according to ''The State of Working America 2004-2005'' by Lawrence Mishel, Jared Bernstein and Sylvia Allegretto.</p> <p>But in my case, even that modest premium was illusory. My new white-collar job required a car and crazy hours; there was little overtime pay. The progressive tax system probably further eroded the college premium, because higher earnings were subject to higher levies.</p> <p>In 2003, the most recent year for which the book contained data, the male college wage differential was 41.5 percent -- practically double what it was when I started out. Although it's possible that my current modest prosperity is entirely a result of good looks (that would account for why it's so modest), chances are that education played a big role in making me better off financially than the doormen among whom I once worked.</p> <p>In coming years, the earnings premium for educated Americans will probably increase because of factors like new technology, outsourcing, large numbers of unskilled immigrants and the tendency of the educated to marry one another. Within the economic arena, I doubt that much can be done about this differential.</p> <p>Today, it's doubtful that many college graduates would envy the pay and benefits of most blue-collar workers. Those who inherit money, meanwhile, can't be blamed for their own dumb luck. So most of us direct our class-based ire at what might be called the new earnings aristocracy. Consider Sanford I. Weill, the former Citigroup chairman, who made nearly $1 billion on the job yet still departs with an annual pension exceeding $1 million -- as well as medical and dental insurance. Or how about William W. McGuire, the chief executive of the UnitedHealth Group, who is reported by The Wall Street Journal to have $1.6 billion in unrealized gains on stock options when workers and employers are battling over who will pay for soaring medical premiums?</p> <p>THAT'S where the guillotine comes in. I'm not expecting anything like the French Revolution, of course. The guillotine I'm talking about is more figurative than literal. It could take the form of punitive marginal tax rates, new trade barriers or excessive regulation of private enterprise -- changes that will make everyone poorer.</p> <p>If those at the top of the heap are really so smart, they should start advocating some orderly increase in redistribution -- at the very least, in the form of national health coverage. They should do this if only to maintain social peace -- to prevent the less fortunate, in other words, from losing their heads. Because, if that happens, the rich may lose theirs as well.</p> <p>ON THE CONTRARY Daniel Akst is a journalist and novelist who writes often about business.

Even at that point, however, I was still in the hole. Think of all those semesters of forgone earnings. Think of the tuition, room, board and bookstore expenses. And think about the cost of all that capital.</p> <p>I have to acknowledge that in those days, I resented the wages of Teamsters and sanitation workers almost as much as I did hereditary wealth. Much has been written lately about the enormous earnings advantage conferred by a college education, but what's striking to me is that this advantage was once so scant. Thirty years ago, in fact, the economist Richard Freeman published a book called ''The Over-educated American,'' and although I was too young and stupid to realize it, I was one.</p> <p>It's true that I chose a line of work -- newspapers -- that is notorious for low entry-level wages, but the broader data bear me out. In 1978, men with a bachelor's degree had an estimated wage premium of just 21 percent over men who were high school graduates, according to ''The State of Working America 2004-2005'' by Lawrence Mishel, Jared Bernstein and Sylvia Allegretto.</p> <p>But in my case, even that modest premium was illusory. My new white-collar job required a car and crazy hours; there was little overtime pay. The progressive tax system probably further eroded the college premium, because higher earnings were subject to higher levies.</p> <p>In 2003, the most recent year for which the book contained data, the male college wage differential was 41.5 percent -- practically double what it was when I started out. Although it's possible that my current modest prosperity is entirely a result of good looks (that would account for why it's so modest), chances are that education played a big role in making me better off financially than the doormen among whom I once worked.</p> <p>In coming years, the earnings premium for educated Americans will probably increase because of factors like new technology, outsourcing, large numbers of unskilled immigrants and the tendency of the educated to marry one another. Within the economic arena, I doubt that much can be done about this differential.</p> <p>Today, it's doubtful that many college graduates would envy the pay and benefits of most blue-collar workers. Those who inherit money, meanwhile, can't be blamed for their own dumb luck. So most of us direct our class-based ire at what might be called the new earnings aristocracy. Consider Sanford I.

But now the Army, along with other branches of the armed services, is facing a serious recruiting gap that is forcing it to rethink its hiring practices and marketing strategy. The proposed changes in tactics outlined in an article in Monday's Times seem like a good start on what is likely to be a long and difficult effort to turn things around. As a collateral benefit, these changes may help society as well.</p> <p>Officials at the Pentagon offer several reasons for the declining lack of interest in military service. One is purely statistical. The pool of young men and women between the ages of 18 and 22, the optimum age for recruits, has shrunk to about 21 million, down 5 million from the 1980 level. Meanwhile, a robust economy has created abundant job opportunities for those who might otherwise be interested in enlisting, while making it financially feasible for more young people to attend college.</p> <p>There may also be more amorphous influences at work. Louis Caldera, the Secretary of the Army, notes that many of the parents of the present generation of recruits came of age after the draft ended in 1973, and thus have no tradition of military service to pass along to their offspring. Representative Steve Buyer, an Indiana Republican who heads the House subcommittee on military personnel, believes that the armed forces have never codified their basic mission since the end of the cold war and, under President Clinton, have begun to resemble an international fire brigade with poorly defined, helter-skelter responsibilities that might best be left to regional powers.</p> <p>Whatever the reason, the numbers are not good. When the fiscal year ends tomorrow, the Army will fall short of its goal for the second year in a row, signing up 7,000 fewer enlistees than the 74,500 it needs to maintain its force at current levels. The Air Force is expected to miss its target by a lesser amount and the Navy will just squeak by. Only the Marine Corps has kept pace. Like all the services, the Army has increased its advertising, raised its ''signing bonuses'' and increased its contribution to a recruit's post-military college tuition from $40,000 to $50,000. The Army has also sent young soldiers back into their neighborhoods to deliver pep talks to their civilian contemporaries.</p> <p>These tactics make sense, but the most promising strategy may lie, paradoxically, in the Pentagon's willingness to ease its standards. Under present rules, 90 percent of the Army's recruits must have at least a high school diploma. In recent years, however, the Army has found that recruits with lesser academic credentials like a general equivalency diploma -- G.E.D. for short -- have performed just as well as those with high school degrees. Thus, just as the Navy did last year, the Army is thinking of relaxing the 90 percent requirement, allowing more G.E.D. students into its ranks. It is also planning a pilot program that will pay 6,000 high school dropouts to pursue a G.E.D. so they can qualify to join the active force or the reserves.

Families making below $100,000 a year would receive the full benefits of the proposals, while those with incomes up to $120,000 would receive reduced benefits.</p> <p>The proposals would expand, but not replace, existing education tax credits and scholarships, which Congress enacted in 1997 at Mr. Clinton's request.</p> <p>The initiatives face an uncertain prospect in this election year, with Republicans in Congress hesitant to give Mr. Clinton any political advantage. A more ambitious tax cut package pushed by Senators Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, and Olympia J. Snowe, Republican of Maine, won bipartisan support last year but eventually died.</p> <p>''Some in Congress, I note, are saying that because this is an election year we really shouldn't try to do anything for the American people,'' Mr. Clinton said.

Recently, Ms. Leonard advised a high school student with poor grades but a passion for automobiles, finding him an internship at an elite racing car company.</p> <p>She thought it could lead to a well-paid career. But the boy's parents were incensed, insisting that he go to college. Ms. Leonard suspects he will soon drop out and take less desirable work than the internship he rejected.</p> <p>This kind of thing is happening all over the country because of an illusion that college is for everyone and that a high-tech future requires as many college graduates as possible. Yet the Department of Labor expects only about a fourth of future jobs to require college degrees.</p> <p>Barbara Schneider and David Stevenson, authors of ''The Ambitious Generation: America's Teenagers, Motivated but Directionless'' (1999), say exaggerated beliefs about job needs can have dire results. Some 90 percent of seniors say they will go to college. Some 35 percent want to be engineers, architects, health professionals, social or natural scientists. But only 8 percent of openings will be in those fields.</p> <p>Many youths face this reality only after high school. Two-thirds of graduates enroll in college, but only half of these get bachelor's degrees by their late 20's. Another 15 percent finish community college. More than a third drop out with no degree, though some may return later.</p> <p>It is often said that without college a youth will be ''flipping hamburgers.'' But many good jobs -- computer and health technicians, equipment repair or finance personnel -- demand vocational or on-the-job training, not bachelor's degrees.</p> <p>Students who are unsuited for college but still attend may lose the chance for such jobs. In their cases, the flipping hamburgers myth could become reality.</p> <p>If all races and social classes have similar academic ability, then even in middle-class suburbs a goodly number of students should incline to technical careers.</p> <p>But parents won't hear of it.</p> <p>In some suburbs -- Montclair, N.J., is one -- counselors are pressured to get almost all students into college because if admission rates fall, children may switch to private schools. So youngsters are guided to universities even when they would benefit more from technical training.</p> <p>In less affluent communities too, uncritical college ambitions can impede counseling. Indeed, black adolescents plan on college at higher rates than whites. Glenda Rose, a high school adviser in Miami, says her efforts to help minority students get into technical schools are resisted by parents who believe a university education is now essential. Many students then drop out of college to take less rewarding jobs than those for which training programs prepare.</p> <p>Ms. Rose blames the media, church leaders and former President Bill Clinton (who urged universal college) for parents' misconceptions.</p> <p>Of course, job readiness is not the only reason for college, perhaps not the best reason. But today's push to prepare all students to attend does not mostly come from concern for their moral, cultural or intellectual growth. It stems from vocational myths.</p> <p>This will be tough to fix because aiming too low is worse than aiming too high. Counselors who urge some students to pursue nonacademic paths may confuse ability with race and class. The affluent have traditionally gone to college while minority and working-class children were tracked to training programs or workplaces, even when their talent justified college ambitions.</p> <p>But asking everyone to attend college does not serve all students well. Nor should universities have to devote resources to failing youngsters who don't belong.</p> <p>Somehow we've got to guide fewer students to college while also ensuring that higher education is more accessible to the disadvantaged.</p> <p>A first step should be adding counselors with improved training. Nationwide, there is now only one counselor for every 560 pupils, handling not only college and career advice but scheduling and discipline. Students cannot get good guidance with so little attention.</p> <p>Schools also need more business partners to set up internships and other school-to-work programs. Adolescents can then experience an adult world of more than doctors and lawyers on the one hand and fast-food workers on the other.</p> <p>But better counseling cannot thrive in a climate of unreality. No pupils should be impeded by race or class from striving for prestigious professions. This, however, should not mean telling all that they can make it.</p> <p>LESSONS</p>",1317382,One Answer on College Doesn't Fit All Graduates,,191,0,,690,Find documents which describe an advantage in hiring potential or increased income for graduates of U.S. colleges.,college education advantage

Recently, Ms. Leonard advised a high school student with poor grades but a passion for automobiles, finding him an internship at an elite racing car company.</p> <p>She thought it could lead to a well-paid career. But the boy's parents were incensed, insisting that he go to college. Ms. Leonard suspects he will soon drop out and take less desirable work than the internship he rejected.</p> <p>This kind of thing is happening all over the country because of an illusion that college is for everyone and that a high-tech future requires as many college graduates as possible. Yet the Department of Labor expects only about a fourth of future jobs to require college degrees.</p> <p>Barbara Schneider and David Stevenson, authors of ''The Ambitious Generation: America's Teenagers, Motivated but Directionless'' (1999), say exaggerated beliefs about job needs can have dire results. Some 90 percent of seniors say they will go to college. Some 35 percent want to be engineers, architects, health professionals, social or natural scientists. But only 8 percent of openings will be in those fields.</p> <p>Many youths face this reality only after high school. Two-thirds of graduates enroll in college, but only half of these get bachelor's degrees by their late 20's. Another 15 percent finish community college. More than a third drop out with no degree, though some may return later.</p> <p>It is often said that without college a youth will be ''flipping hamburgers.'' But many good jobs -- computer and health technicians, equipment repair or finance personnel -- demand vocational or on-the-job training, not bachelor's degrees.</p> <p>Students who are unsuited for college but still attend may lose the chance for such jobs. In their cases, the flipping hamburgers myth could become reality.</p> <p>If all races and social classes have similar academic ability, then even in middle-class suburbs a goodly number of students should incline to technical careers.</p> <p>But parents won't hear of it.</p> <p>In some suburbs -- Montclair, N.J., is one -- counselors are pressured to get almost all students into college because if admission rates fall, children may switch to private schools. So youngsters are guided to universities even when they would benefit more from technical training.</p> <p>In less affluent communities too, uncritical college ambitions can impede counseling. Indeed, black adolescents plan on college at higher rates than whites. Glenda Rose, a high school adviser in Miami, says her efforts to help minority students get into technical schools are resisted by parents who believe a university education is now essential. Many students then drop out of college to take less rewarding jobs than those for which training programs prepare.</p> <p>Ms. Rose blames the media, church leaders and former President Bill Clinton (who urged universal college) for parents' misconceptions.</p> <p>Of course, job readiness is not the only reason for college, perhaps not the best reason. But today's push to prepare all students to attend does not mostly come from concern for their moral, cultural or intellectual growth. It stems from vocational myths.</p> <p>This will be tough to fix because aiming too low is worse than aiming too high. Counselors who urge some students to pursue nonacademic paths may confuse ability with race and class. The affluent have traditionally gone to college while minority and working-class children were tracked to training programs or workplaces, even when their talent justified college ambitions.</p> <p>But asking everyone to attend college does not serve all students well. Nor should universities have to devote resources to failing youngsters who don't belong.</p> <p>Somehow we've got to guide fewer students to college while also ensuring that higher education is more accessible to the disadvantaged.</p> <p>A first step should be adding counselors with improved training. Nationwide, there is now only one counselor for every 560 pupils, handling not only college and career advice but scheduling and discipline. Students cannot get good guidance with so little attention.</p> <p>Schools also need more business partners to set up internships and other school-to-work programs. Adolescents can then experience an adult world of more than doctors and lawyers on the one hand and fast-food workers on the other.</p> <p>But better counseling cannot thrive in a climate of unreality. No pupils should be impeded by race or class from striving for prestigious professions. This, however, should not mean telling all that they can make it.</p> <p>LESSONS</p>",1317382,One Answer on College Doesn't Fit All Graduates,,191,0,,690,Find documents which describe an advantage in hiring potential or increased income for graduates of U.S. colleges.,college education advantage

Unless you look very carefully through your enlistment papers and sign away future benefits, the government will take out $100 a month during the first year of service. Consider it a down payment for benefits to come.</p> <p>After three years of service, though, the benefits are worth a lot more than that initial investment. Veterans can get more than $36,000 for tuition, books, living expenses and most anything else that might come up, provided the money is used within 10 years.</p> <p>''We've still got work to do in understanding why people are paying into a program and then not availing themselves of its use,'' says Dennis B. Douglass, deputy director for education service at the Department of Veterans Affairs. ''Some of them are not only unaware that these benefits expire, but they are not even aware of the benefits available to them.''</p> <p>Today's participation rates are not exactly poor by historical standards. According to V.A. statistics, about half of eligible World War II veterans, or 7.8 million, took advantage of the education benefits under the first G.I. Bill of Rights. It was this bill that helped make higher education such an integral part of society.</p> <p>The enthusiasm of veterans of the Korean War era slipped a little, with about 4 in 10 using their education benefits. But even so, no less than 2.4 million of those veterans went to college on the government's dime.</p> <p>By the end of the Vietnam War, more veterans than ever were going to school under the G.I. Bill, about 8.2 million. But since the late 1970's only about two million have taken advantage of the benefits. Still, that's almost 7 in 10 veterans, a ratio that is only slightly lower than during the Vietnam era because of the overall decline in recent veterans.</p> <p>To stimulate more interest, the government has been pushing to remind soon-to-be veterans that money for college or training awaits them after discharge and that the benefits will expire. The size of the benefit has gone up, too, to about $1,000 a month for a full-time student. As recently as 2000, the stipend was $650 a month, so officials hope the increase will be enough to get more veterans to go to class. Benefits for reservists and National Guardsmen have been raised from $288 a month to as much as $800, depending on how long they have been on active duty.</p> <p>Beyond that, the benefits have expanded to include forms of education that the framers of the original G.I. Bill could not have envisioned. Veterans can now get larger lump sums for costly short-term training in technology-intensive fields like aerospace, computers and biotechnology. Benefits also pay for tests required for a professional license or certificate in fields as diverse as plumbing and medicine.</p> <p>''While the veteran of the 1940's was going to school to get ahead of the curve,'' Mr. Douglass says, ''the veteran of today is doing it because he's just trying to keep pace.''</p> <p>COLLEGE AND MONEY</p>",1642208,From Combat To Campus On the G.I.

Children with and without disabilities are in class together and learning.</p> <p>In a fifth-grade classroom on a recent morning, 36 children sat on cushions and couches discussing geometry. It was hard to make out that eight children were either learning disabled or emotionally disturbed. Two teachers, including  one licensed in special education, taught the class together as a teacher's aide hovered.</p> <p>In another classroom, a second-grade teacher read aloud from an oversized book with a cluster of students in a corner, while another teacher patiently listened as a boy read on the floor. One girl skimmed alone through an advanced-level book with chapters.</p> <p>About 115 special-education students attend P.S. 321, out of 1,200 children in the school. In the three years since the inclusion program began, the number  of classes exclusively for special-education children there has shrunk from nine to six, as more children have returned to the regular classrooms.

We educate artists and clients about both the potential and limitations of new technology. And we put together the best imaginable teams of artists and programmers.</p> <p>Q. Sounds like you are creating a virtual corporation.</p> <p>A. The lifeblood of the industry is the independent artists and multimedia developers who still answer their own phones, don't get much sleep and are brilliant. They're the new-media garage bands.</p> <p>Q. When do you think interactivity will hit the popular culture?</p> <p>A. We're seeing a few best-selling interactive games and storybooks like ""Myst,"" ""Doom,"" ""Grandma and Me."" The numbers are still not close to what you get with a paperback best seller or box office hit. I like to think that will happen soon.</p> <p>Q. What aspect of the digital revolution is being overlooked?</p> <p>A. We need to remember that it's artists who create. Computers are just tools -- no more, no less inspired than Rembrandt's paintbrush.</p> <p>Q. What coming technologies are you waiting for?</p> <p>A. Many new media tools are still awfully clunky and awkward to use. I look forward to the day when digital tools are transparent and artists can collaborate on line.</p> <p>Q. What advice would you give a company getting involved in interactive products?</p> <p>A. There's no substitute for vision, talent and content. Only make those interactive products that will add depth to the user's experience. There are still few experiences more interactive than slouching in a leather armchair with a great novel.

Unfortunately, this is not true of the organizations of disabled people, or the voluntary and charitable organizations serving them. Reduced government programs and charitable giving have seriously threatened many fine organizations serving the disabled, and a shortage of housing and medical services has created a critical situation for the disabled themselves.</p> <p>Fully 10 percent of our population is handicapped to a degree that hinders their ability to function. Their problems have a heavy impact on their families and the social-welfare agencies of our city, public and private.</p> <p>Those who would aspire to be mayor of New York City must consider these issues:</p> <p>* Despite efforts by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority and others to make mass transit more accessible to the disabled, the vast majority of the disabled find it extremely difficult to hold jobs or to get around because of transportation problems. The paratransit system has never really got off the ground in any meaningful way, and there are few alternatives.</p> <p>* Affordable housing for the disabled is not available, despite a new law requiring all new construction to be handicapped-accessible. The law adds the costs to construction, which are passed on in higher rents to the disabled, as well as others. This well-meaning law needs revision. In the meantime, disabled adults live with aging parents, in nursing homes or in the nonhousing offered the homeless.</p> <p>* The special-education program of the Board of Education generally lags far behind such programs in other cities. Few new facilities have been built, and handicapped students often languish in deteriorating buildings and overcrowded classrooms under the myth of ''mainstreaming.''</p> <p>* Recent changes in immigration laws make it possible to import an alien to shovel manure at Belmont Park, but not to bring in an alien to assist a handicapped person with essentials of daily living!</p> <p>* Loneliness and isolation are the great enemies of the disabled in our large city. Fewer than 10 percent of churches and synagogues are accessible, or welcoming, to the disabled and their families. Parks and recreation centers are hardly safe havens. Only under ''supervised'' circumstances will the disabled venture into the cultural life around them.</p> <p>No person deserves to lead New York City who will ignore the needs of this deserving segment of our population.

Environmentalists and development proponents, often at odds, would cheer. Thanks to the Frank Weeden Foundation of Connecticut, there's no need to imagine. It has provided a way to buy, in effect, bonds for biology.</p> <p>In July, Conservation International, a nonprofit U.S. environmental group, used a $100,000 Weeden grant to buy discounted Bolivian debt certificates. Then it swapped these to the Bolivian Government in exchange for its agreement to expand the Beni Biosphere Reserve. The reserve, in Bolivia's Amazon basin, is home to 13 species of endangered plants and animals, more than 500 different varieties of birds and more species of trees than all North America.</p> <p>In August, Costa Rica launched a more systematic program, run through its Ministry of Natural Resources. Potential donors are now being solicited to buy $5.4 million of outstanding debt, to be recycled through the Central Bank for local currency bonds. Revenues will go for land acquisition, park management and reforestation. For Costa Rica, reforestation also makes possible future export earnings from harvests of precious woods.</p> <p>The third world's low credit rating these days actually works to multiply the value of an environmentally linked donation. Bankers' jitters about possible debt moratoriums and defaults have driven debt prices well below face value. U.S. dollars used to buy up debt certificates thus yield far more than their normal equivalent in local funds. In the case of Costa Rica, a donation of $250,000 would pay for environmental bonds worth $500,000.</p> <p>Swaps like these can meet only a fraction of outstanding third world debt. Costa Rica's program aims to convert a little more than 10 percent of its total debt burden, Bolivia's about 15 percent. But the bonds do give interested donors a way to help conquer two urgent third world problems.</p> <p>Governments and multinational institutions could play an even greater role. Senators Alfonse D'Amato of New York and Robert Kasten of Wisconsin, and Representatives John Porter of Illinois and David Obey of Wisconsin, are sponsoring legislation that would direct the U.S. representative at the World Bank to propose an environmentally linked debt relief program through the bank.

The world wants Brazil to stop recklessly destroying the Amazon rain forest, an extraordinary natural wonder. Those two conditions invite a deal, a grand debt-for-nature swap that would ease Brazil's burden of foreign borrowing and preserve the Amazon forests. What stands in the way of so compelling a solution? Brazil's President, Jose Sarney, for one thing. Last month his Foreign Minister, Roberto de Abreu Sodre, received an American delegation that included Thomas Lovejoy, a tropical biologist, and Senators Tim Wirth, Albert Gore and John Heinz. Mr. Sodre enthusiastically endorsed the idea of a Brazilian foundation to administer a debt-for-nature swap.
