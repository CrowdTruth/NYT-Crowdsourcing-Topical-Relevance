A month after leaving the cult, Mr. Ford last week discovered the bodies of the 39 members who committed suicide in Rancho Santa Fe, Calif. He had received a package containing two videotapes announcing the members' intentions.</p> <p>Anne Riccitelli, an ABC spokeswoman in New York, confirmed that the network had ''signed a development deal on this subject,'' but ABC officials said that so far there was no script, proposed cast or broadcast commitment.</p> <p>Kushner-Locke, which has produced television movies with stars like Dolly Parton and Louis Gossett Jr., hired Mr. Ford and the cult's commercial arm, Higher Source, some months ago to design its World Wide Web site. Later, the company put Mr. Ford in touch with Interact, another designer of Web sites that hired him after he left the cult.</p> <p>Separately, the ABC News program ''Prime Time'' showed on Wednesday night what it described as the first pictures of Mr. Ford and promised an exclusive interview with him next week.</p>",920343,ABC Signs Film Deal On the Cult,,,,2,1,,,,325,Describe a cult by name and identify the cult members' activities in their everyday life.,Cult Lifestyles

So the Government will not fall or have to submit itself to a vote of confidence.</p> <p>Nonetheless it showed how tenuous is Mr. Major's hold over his own party, which is trailing the opposition Labor Party by some 30 points in public opinion polls. In Parliament, the Conservative majority has shrunk to five and that could be reduced further by two off-year elections scheduled before the next general election, which must be held by the spring of 1997.</p> <p>Mr. Major's stature among the party's right-wing ""Euro-skeptics,"" who oppose  allowing more power to slip away to Brussels as provided by the Treaty on European Unity, had already been damaged by events on Friday at the European Union summit meeting in Madrid. Leaders of the 15-country group resolved to press ahead with plans for a single currency beginning in January 1999, and to call it the euro.</p> <p>The Prime Minister sought to apply the brakes to the single currency, arguing in Madrid that such a momentous step should not be taken precipitously and that  the economies of many member nations were not yet ready. But his efforts were brushed aside by the other leaders, especially by Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany. Britain and Denmark have negotiated the right to opt out of the single  currency, which Euro-skeptics see as a final capitulation that would lead inevitably to political union.</p> <p>The Tory right wing wants Mr. Major to promise that he would rule out British membership in the single currency for the life of the current Parliament, meaning through 1996. He has refused, arguing that to do so would relegate Britain to the sidelines and remove any influence he might have during critical  talks next year about Europe's future.</p>",817222,Tory Skepticism on Europe Brings Major Another Defeat,,,,63,2,,,,378,"Identify documents that discuss opposition to the use of the euro, the European currency.",euro opposition

Along with corsages and doctoral hoods, most graduates,  professors and administrators wore a round yellow sticker that read: ""No cuts! No firings! Defend Queens College.""</p> <p>The stickers were a response to threatened state budget cuts. Faculty and staff members handed out the yellow stickers to the 3,500 graduates and their families. They also distributed letters for people to sign and send to state legislators.</p> <p>Most of the speakers referred to the budget dispute. Carolyn Goodman, the mother of Andrew Goodman, a Queens College student who was killed during the Mississippi Freedom Summer in 1964, received the Queens College President's Medal. Dr. Goodman, who tearfully noted that Andrew would have celebrated his 30th reunion this year, said she had testified at a budget hearing on campus two weeks ago.</p> <p>Although the college presented a solid front at graduation -- even the president, Dr. Allen Lee Sessoms, wore a sticker -- there were less cordial undertones. During the applause after Dr. Sessoms' speech, the faculty section was noticeably silent. Dr. Sessoms had refused to allow the chairwoman of the faculty and staff union, Barbara Bowen, to speak at the main commencement, although she did speak at a later ceremony.</p> <p>One student representative, Jose R. Peralta, referred to the dispute over Ms. Bowen's speech, saying he would speak for her. He asked the students to repeat after him:</p> <p>""Whether I live in Park Avenue or Park Slope, my education is my right,"" they said in unison. ""Whether I make $50,000 or $5 an hour, my education is my right. So, Governor Pataki, stop the crime and fund education.""</p> <p>Brooklyn College</p> <p>The chancellor of California State University, Barry Munitz, told more than 1,700 Brooklyn College graduates at their commencement yesterday to vote and to  make sure that they got others to register to vote.</p> <p>Mr. Munitz, a 1963 Brooklyn College graduate, also exhorted the students to embrace change and to be active members of society.</p> <p>Among the colorfully robed swarms of graduates (bachelor's degree recipients  wore lavender; master's degree recipients wore black) were more than 100 alumni  from the class of 1946, all wearing gold robes.</p> <p>""It's a grand feeling to be here today,"" said Sylvia Deutsch, a 1946 alumna who is a former chairwoman of the New York City Planning Commission. She and her husband, Leon, a retired New York State Family Court judge, gave a joint address.</p> <p>They reminded those gathered that the class of 1946 had struggled through the Depression and World War II to build their lives. Then the couple told the students to expect adversity.

The new guidelines contain strong language making it clear that they are advisory and impose no new legal requirements. That language will make it harder for injured workers or their unions to successfully sue nursing homes for failing to follow the guidelines.</p> <p>''They're good guidelines,'' said Janice Zalen, an occupational safety expert at the American Health Care Association, which represents 12,000 nursing homes. ''I think they took seriously our concerns and incorporated our concerns. They're a good deal.''</p>",1472209,Nursing Home Worker Safety Guidelines,,,,95,0,,,,350,Is it hazardous to the health of individuals to work with computer terminals on a daily basis?,Health and Computer Terminals

Defend Queens College.""</p> <p>The stickers were a response to threatened state budget cuts. Faculty and staff members handed out the yellow stickers to the 3,500 graduates and their families. They also distributed letters for people to sign and send to state legislators.</p> <p>Most of the speakers referred to the budget dispute. Carolyn Goodman, the mother of Andrew Goodman, a Queens College student who was killed during the Mississippi Freedom Summer in 1964, received the Queens College President's Medal. Dr. Goodman, who tearfully noted that Andrew would have celebrated his 30th reunion this year, said she had testified at a budget hearing on campus two weeks ago.</p> <p>Although the college presented a solid front at graduation -- even the president, Dr. Allen Lee Sessoms, wore a sticker -- there were less cordial undertones. During the applause after Dr. Sessoms' speech, the faculty section was noticeably silent. Dr. Sessoms had refused to allow the chairwoman of the faculty and staff union, Barbara Bowen, to speak at the main commencement, although she did speak at a later ceremony.</p> <p>One student representative, Jose R. Peralta, referred to the dispute over Ms. Bowen's speech, saying he would speak for her. He asked the students to repeat after him:</p> <p>""Whether I live in Park Avenue or Park Slope, my education is my right,"" they said in unison. ""Whether I make $50,000 or $5 an hour, my education is my right. So, Governor Pataki, stop the crime and fund education.""</p> <p>Brooklyn College</p> <p>The chancellor of California State University, Barry Munitz, told more than 1,700 Brooklyn College graduates at their commencement yesterday to vote and to  make sure that they got others to register to vote.</p> <p>Mr. Munitz, a 1963 Brooklyn College graduate, also exhorted the students to embrace change and to be active members of society.</p> <p>Among the colorfully robed swarms of graduates (bachelor's degree recipients  wore lavender; master's degree recipients wore black) were more than 100 alumni  from the class of 1946, all wearing gold robes.</p> <p>""It's a grand feeling to be here today,"" said Sylvia Deutsch, a 1946 alumna who is a former chairwoman of the New York City Planning Commission. She and her husband, Leon, a retired New York State Family Court judge, gave a joint address.</p> <p>They reminded those gathered that the class of 1946 had struggled through the Depression and World War II to build their lives. Then the couple told the students to expect adversity. ""But like us, you've been equipped with a great advantage -- a Brooklyn College education,"" Mr. Deutsch said.</p> <p>Bronx Community College</p> <p>In a commencement speech at Bronx Community College, the Bronx District Attorney, Robert T.

New York State, with its vast numbers of poor, cannot afford to worsen the trend. Given that imperative, one of the signal issues in Albany this spring is the dispute over funding for public colleges and universities -- the schools of choice for low-income New Yorkers seeking to better their lot.</p> <p>The 21-campus City University of New York and the 64-campus State University  of New York certainly need restructuring -- and perhaps even some campus closings -- to meet new fiscal realities. But cuts in student aid proposed by Gov. George Pataki have frightened even fiscal conservatives, many of whom see the cuts as too much, too fast -- and an unfair blow to the poor.</p> <p>CUNY and SUNY have experienced a steady series of cuts in state funding -- often with dramatic consequences. The two systems were forced to impose tuition  increases of $750 last year -- from $2,650 to $3,400 at SUNY and from $2,450 to  $3,200 at CUNY. The higher fees drove out many struggling students, and were partly responsible for a combined enrollment drop of 16,000 in the two systems.</p> <p>Now Mr. Pataki is proposing dramatic cuts and formula changes in the Tuition  Assistance Program, known as TAP, that would make it even harder for low-income  students to attend college. In New York City alone, TAP cuts would cause 50,000  students to lose up to $1,029 each per year -- with the heaviest hit on families earning under $16,000.</p> <p>The SUNY board of trustees, now controlled by Mr. Pataki, has not protested the cuts. But an internal SUNY analysis shows justifiable worry on the front lines. At SUNY Binghamton, for example, 65 percent of the TAP recipients would lose an average of $934 each -- a ruinous sum for poor and lower-middle-class students. At some community colleges, low-income students would lose roughly 60  percent of their state aid. The administration also proposes letting aid increases lag a year behind tuition increases, further pressing poor families.</p> <p>The Pataki administration says the cuts are warranted because New York is overly generous, spending three times as much on tuition assistance as Pennsylvania, Illinois or California. It estimates that, even after the cuts, nearly a third of New York's 300,000 TAP recipients will receive full-tuition scholarships. But tuition is less than half the cost of an actual SUNY or CUNY education.</p> <p>State Education Commissioner Richard P. Mills was on the mark when he argued  against the cuts, saying that the TAP was an investment in New York's future --  and in a more highly skilled work force. That investment is already falling short of what is needed. Despite substantial enrollment increases over the last  decade, higher education aid has grown more slowly in New York than in almost any other state. Before shifting costs onto the shoulders of struggling families, Mr. Pataki needs to look hard for economies elsewhere. The Legislature needs to resolve the TAP debate quickly. Uncertainty over student aid could prompt many New Yorkers not to apply to college at all.</p>",835331,Keep College Open to the Poor,,,,182,1,,,,690,Find documents which describe an advantage in hiring potential or increased income for graduates of U.S. colleges.,college education advantage
