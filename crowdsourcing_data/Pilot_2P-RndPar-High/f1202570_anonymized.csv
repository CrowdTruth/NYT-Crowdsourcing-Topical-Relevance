This week many a busily keyboarding finger will encounter its first euro figure and stop in midair: Which key to hit?",,,,,,,,,,,"Most world currencies are signified by ordinary letters, like the German mark (DM), but dollars and pounds have familiar, easily typed symbols of their own ($ and $:). Desiring the same cachet, the European Union created a euro ''glyph'' and asked the computer and software worlds to accommodate it somehow.",,"Not surprisingly, it's a case of one currency, many approaches. For instance, Microsoft decided that the symbol should take on the look of whichever type font is in use when it is typed, but Apple Computer thinks its look should never vary.","On new Windows keyboards sold in Europe, the right-hand ''alt'' key and the ''e'' key struck together will make the euro symbol; in America, at least for now, users will have to depress the alt key and type 0128 on the numeric keypad. And that's only if the computer's type fonts are of recent-enough vintage -- the last few months or so -- to include the symbol.","In new Macintosh fonts, the euro symbol replaces a little-used international currency symbol, a circle with four spokes, usually obtained by striking option-shift-2.",Typewriter users (remember typewriters?) will have to fake it.

The administration also proposes letting aid increases lag a year behind tuition increases, further pressing poor families.","The Pataki administration says the cuts are warranted because New York is overly generous, spending three times as much on tuition assistance as Pennsylvania, Illinois or California.

Along with corsages and doctoral hoods, most graduates,  professors and administrators wore a round yellow sticker that read: ""No cuts! No firings! Defend Queens College.""","Among the colorfully robed swarms of graduates (bachelor's degree recipients  wore lavender; master's degree recipients wore black) were more than 100 alumni  from the class of 1946, all wearing gold robes.","""It's a grand feeling to be here today,"" said Sylvia Deutsch, a 1946 alumna who is a former chairwoman of the New York City Planning Commission. She and her husband, Leon, a retired New York State Family Court judge, gave a joint address.","They reminded those gathered that the class of 1946 had struggled through the Depression and World War II to build their lives. Then the couple told the students to expect adversity. ""But like us, you've been equipped with a great advantage -- a Brooklyn College education,"" Mr. Deutsch said.",Bronx Community College,"In a commencement speech at Bronx Community College, the Bronx District Attorney, Robert T. Johnson, commended the graduating class yesterday for achieving academic success despite the often overwhelming demands of full-time jobs and family responsibilities.",COMMENCEMENTS,,,,,"The stickers were a response to threatened state budget cuts. Faculty and staff members handed out the yellow stickers to the 3,500 graduates and their families. They also distributed letters for people to sign and send to state legislators.",,"Most of the speakers referred to the budget dispute. Carolyn Goodman, the mother of Andrew Goodman, a Queens College student who was killed during the Mississippi Freedom Summer in 1964, received the Queens College President's Medal. Dr. Goodman, who tearfully noted that Andrew would have celebrated his 30th reunion this year, said she had testified at a budget hearing on campus two weeks ago.","Although the college presented a solid front at graduation -- even the president, Dr. Allen Lee Sessoms, wore a sticker -- there were less cordial undertones. During the applause after Dr. Sessoms' speech, the faculty section was noticeably silent. Dr. Sessoms had refused to allow the chairwoman of the faculty and staff union, Barbara Bowen, to speak at the main commencement, although she did speak at a later ceremony.","One student representative, Jose R. Peralta, referred to the dispute over Ms. Bowen's speech, saying he would speak for her. He asked the students to repeat after him:","""Whether I live in Park Avenue or Park Slope, my education is my right,"" they said in unison. ""Whether I make $50,000 or $5 an hour, my education is my right. So, Governor Pataki, stop the crime and fund education.""",Brooklyn College,"The chancellor of California State University, Barry Munitz, told more than 1,700 Brooklyn College graduates at their commencement yesterday to vote and to  make sure that they got others to register to vote.","Mr. Munitz, a 1963 Brooklyn College graduate, also exhorted the students to embrace change and to be active members of society.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,690,Find documents which describe an advantage in hiring potential or increased income for graduates of U.S. colleges.,college education advantage
