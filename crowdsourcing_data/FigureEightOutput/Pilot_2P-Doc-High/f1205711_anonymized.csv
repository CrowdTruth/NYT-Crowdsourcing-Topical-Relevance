Paper, $23.95.</p> <p>A woman in the Islamic northern Sudan lives what appears to be a beleaguered life. Before she is 10, a midwife circumcises her, snipping off her clitoris and stitching together the outer labia. In her late teens, she beautifies herself for marriage by removing all her body hair and scraping off the outer layer of her skin. Reliably virginal at marriage, she is soon abandoned by her husband for most of the year - he works in the city, she remains in the village with the children. Her marriage, in these circumstances, is fragile. Men divorce easily for other women, or take other wives, particularly if the first is barren. Throughout life a woman is legally under the control of her father, her brothers and her husband, and her behavior is tightly regulated.</p> <p>But there are spirits who possess at least some of the women and force them into rude, wanton behavior. Such spirits attack fertility and cause illness. To cure herself, a possessed woman must appease the spirit through ceremonies in which the spirit descends into her and states its demands: new sandals, new clothes, a husband's acquiescence in a wife's desires. These women are then members of the Zar cult.</p> <p>In ''Wombs and Alien Spirits: Women, Men and the Zar Cult in Northern Sudan,'' Janice Boddy - a professor of anthropology at the University of Toronto - has written a traditional ethnography, complete with kinship diagrams, Arabic terms, and many, many facts. By the end of the book you feel that you know her community of women well. The primary impact of post-modernism in anthropology - apart from some silliness - has been to sharpen and sensitize the ethnographer's eye. Ms. Boddy's language and authorial self-description betray the strong influence of post-modern theory. That influence leads her not to repudiate the business of writing ethnography, but to be highly aware of the multiple purposes and meanings that these women give to their activities. Such alertness lets her provide a better analytic explanation of spirit possession than most.</p> <p>Many anthropologists would interpret a cult such as the Zar as the means through which subordinate individuals express their needs in public. Ms. Boddy argues that the cult does more, that it is the major form of symbolic play for these adults. The spirits that possess them are prostitutes, doctors, military men, gypsies, cannibalistic sorcerers and women of holiness and purity - a range of northern Sudanese cultural characters. This vividly imagined other world, Ms. Boddy argues, is in itself esthetically and creatively rewarding. And through the variety of these self-representations, the cult enables its women to reflect upon their actual world, so that the spirit possession becomes almost a satiric commentary upon their experience of the feminine. Through imaginatively playing at being other, the author suggests, these women become more adept at imagining themselves.</p> <p>''Wombs and Alien Spirits'' is long and at times repetitive and overwritten. Yet much of it is fluent and vivid, and it left me intrigued.</p>",337774,WOMEN POSSESSED,,,,9,2,,,,325,Describe a cult by name and identify the cult members' activities in their everyday life.,Cult Lifestyles

Millions of supports, also known as wrist managers, have been sold. More than a million of the Pro Flex model alone have been sold since 1989, including half amillion this year. The company expects to sell a half million more in 1993. WHY: In 1990 the Bureau of Labor Statistics estimated that of the 46 million Americans using computer keyboards, more than 180,000 suffered from wrist or hand injuries linked to repetitive tasks like typing. The most serious repetitive stress injury, or R.S.I., is carpal tunnel syndrome, a swelling of nerves where they pass through the wrists. That can cause crippling pain, weakness, numbness or tingling in the hands or wrists. Less troubling injuries include a variety of inflammation and swelling problems.</p> <p>WHO NEEDS IT?: You, possibly. In this age of the ubiquitous computer keyboard, the average data-entry office worker will flex his wrists about 5,000 times a day. ""They have become occupational athletes,"" said Paula Newman, a spokeswoman for Ergodyne. WHO ELSE?: Actual athletes, like bowlers, bicyclists, tennis players, golfers and softball players, as well as workers involved in tasks like meat-cutting, operating a cash register, dealing cards or working on an assembly line. ""Basically, anyone who is involved with picking, packing or plucking,"" Ms. Newman said. HOW IT WORKS: Wraps around the wrist with Velcro-like fasteners (Ergodyne's name for hook and loop fasteners is Aplix) and across the palm between the thumb and index finger. The device is designed to keep the wrist straight without immobilizing it. Most older wrist supports contained hard plastic splints and sometimes laced up the forearm like a corset. The Pro Flex has flexible steel stays encased in two synthetic materials, Vinaguard and Ultrilure, that give it as much support as a hard wrist support but increased movement and comfort. WHERE TO BUY IT: See the ergonomic experts where you work. Most Pro Flex supports are sold to them in bulk by safety equipment distributors, but they are also available in some hardware stores and home centers under the Safety Maid label. Average cost: $20. FASHION FACTS: Sizes range from X-Small to X-Large, but there are only two color schemes: tan with navy or black with silver. There are no plans for pastel, fluorescent or leather models, although there have been requests. Ergodyne can customize its wrist supports with logos, company colors, reflective tape or employee numbers. THE REST OF THE LINE: Ergodyne sells matching back supports, foot rests, computer keyboard wrist rests, tennis elbow supports, hand exercisers and anti-vibration gloves (for jack-hammer operators).</p> <p>THING</p>",572210,Wrist Support,,,,99,1,,,,350,Is it hazardous to the health of individuals to work with computer terminals on a daily basis?,Health and Computer Terminals

Although no one is yet sure what tangible benefits will come out of it, the hospital's planners say they expect the computer network to be a pivotal resource for sick children and their families.</p> <p>Other hospitals, like Mount Sinai Hospital in New York and the University of Chicago's Children's Hospital, have used computer-based programs from organizations like the Starlight Children's Foundation and the Starbright Foundation to allow children to connect with other children through protected networks.</p> <p>So far, Montefiore's pediatrics service has done little with educational or entertainment technology. But the technology program at the new hospital will be more ambitious than efforts at other hospitals, said  Dr. Irwin Redlener, president of the Children's Hospital at Montefiore,  and it will involve more patients and their families.</p> <p>Jeb Weisman, senior director of information systems and technology for the Children's Hospital at Montefiore, said he viewed the program as a learning laboratory for health professionals, who can look for new ways to enhance the quality of life for the hospital's patients.</p> <p>''The first question we had to grapple with was 'What's going to be the point of this technology?' '' Mr. Weisman said. ''I think the jury's still out on whether you need a computer at every hospital bed.''</p> <p>But giving patients the power to inform themselves about their illnesses, Mr. Weisman said, will help them connect their experiences to the outside world. ''We have a way to engage the kids at a level that they live at every day,'' he said. ''Technology is a part of their life, and it's going to be part of their future lives and their working lives.''</p> <p>The hospital network will be accessible at bedsides through computer  terminals. Forty-two-inch flat-panel screens will be mounted on the walls, about 11 feet in front of each bed, to show both computer displays and television. In double rooms, the screens will be angled away from each other to ensure privacy. Speakers will be situated in special hospital pillows on the beds.</p> <p>The content on the network will include a range of games and activities for different age groups and an e-mail program to allow children to send messages to friends and teachers and, when other hospitals offer similar services, to other patients at those hospitals.

Gates, the chairman, to help ''set technical direction in the company'' and ''to educate myself on the details of technologies that I have not had the chance to be as 'hands on' as I would have liked over the last several years.''</p> <p>Mr. Maritz said he intended to begin his technical-immersion project by ''writing some'' code using various Microsoft software tool kits including Visual Basic, Visual C++ and Visual J++, and move on to Microsoft's new programming projects.</p> <p>''So be warned,'' Mr. Maritz wrote to the other members of Microsoft's developers group.</p> <p>In the E-mail, Mr. Maritz said he also planned to focus on promoting Microsoft's development tools within the software community.</p> <p>Mr. Maritz's hands-on push into the technology of development tools,  colleagues say, comes as Microsoft is engaged in an effort to both simplify the process of software development and marry its Windows technology with the technology of the Internet.</p> <p>The rise of Internet-based computing poses a continuing challenge, which has been called the post PC era, to Microsoft. The challenge is not that personal computers might go away, or even decline in number, but that computing may no longer revolve so much around PC technology -- which Microsoft dominates with its industry-standard Windows operating system.</p> <p>Accordingly, Microsoft is trying to persuade outside developers to use its software tools instead of the tools of rivals like Sun Microsystems Inc. The goal is to position Microsoft's tools as the glue between PC and Internet technology.</p> <p>''Paul has the experience and respect, both inside and outside Microsoft, to push that initiative hard,'' one Microsoft engineer said.</p> <p>The Wall Street Journal reported yesterday that Mr. Maritz was passing off most of his daily management duties to David Vaskevitch, a vice president in the developers group.</p> <p>Like many senior Microsoft executives, Mr. Maritz, 44, who joined the company in 1986 from the Intel Corporation, is immensely wealthy from his Microsoft shares. In recent months, a number of other top company executives have taken leaves of absence or left the company.</p> <p>Mr. Maritz's move to relinquish most daily management duties raised the question of whether he, too, was about to step out. But in his E-mail, he suggested that was not the case. His shift of assignments, he wrote, did not portend ''some major change, or that I am about to leave the company.''</p>",1126835,Senior Microsoft Executive To Leave Management Job,,,,101,0,,,,350,Is it hazardous to the health of individuals to work with computer terminals on a daily basis?,Health and Computer Terminals

But the documents made public today, in the form of a Cuban National Bank quarterly economic report, showed that imports from the Soviet Union in the first nine months of 1987 declined for the first time in nearly three decades.</p> <p>The papers were submitted by Cuban officials Jan. 18 at a meeting in Paris called by Cuba to try to reschedule its $2.4 billion debt to Western governments - chiefly Spain, France, Britain, West Germany and Japan.</p> <p>Soviet subsidies of Cuba, mainly through Moscow's supply of low-cost oil and its purchase of Cuban sugar at inflated prices, have been estimated at $4 billion to $5 billion a year. The Cuban National Bank document showed that imports from the Soviet Union in the first nine months of last year declined to $3.98 billion from $4.00 billion over the same period of 1986.</p> <p>The papers also provide a stark picture of a deteriorating Cuban economy. Last year was ''one of the worst years the country has had to face,'' said one document, showing that economic activity had contracted by 3.5 percent while investment decreased by more than 20 percent.</p> <p>Cuba owes an additional $3.1 billion to Western banks and suppliers, giving it one of the largest external debts per capita in the world, $2,000 per person, which is twice that owed by the average Brazilian.</p> <p>The disclosure that imports from the Soviet Union are in decline was seen by some experts as evidence of important changes in Cuban-Soviet relations.</p> <p>''It shows that the Soviets are starting to become conscious of the costs of subsidizing the Cuban economy,'' said Manuel Sanchez Perez, a former Cuban Deputy Minister of Material Technical Supply who defected in 1985. 'Can't Afford It Any More'</p> <p>A Reagan Administration expert, who asked not to be identified, made a similar point, saying: ''The Soviets can't afford it any more. They're looking for ways to try to force the Cubans to become more efficient.''</p> <p>Both Mr. Sanchez Perez and the Administration official suggested that Moscow may be signaling displeasure because the economic policies of Fidel Castro seem at variance with the ''perestroika,'' or economic restructuring, of Mikhail S. Gorbachev. Mr. Castro has adopted ''rectification,'' which involves going back to straight ideology and central planning.</p> <p>Moscow has taken other measures to reduce the economic burden that Cuba represents for the Soviet economy.</p> <p>Mr. Sanchez Perez disclosed that according to his sources Moscow had cut its subsidy for Cuban sugar. It now pays 36 cents a pound for sugar that is worth one-fourth that in the world market. But it had been paying 45 cents. The Soviet Union buys about 5.5 million tons of Cuban sugar annually.</p> <p>In addition, Soviet petroleum allocations have also been declining, Mr. Sanchez Perez reported.</p>",128021,Soviet Said to Reduce Support for Cuban Economy,,,,159,2,,,,414,How much sugar does Cuba export and which countries import it?,"Cuba, sugar, exports"

March sugar traded as high as 11 cents a pound during the session.</p> <p>Mexico, which traditionally is a net exporter of sugar, had been rumored earlier in the week to have purchased 75,000 metric tons of sugar from the French trade house Sucres et Denrees.

Quite the contrary, those summers gave me the wherewithal to grab a low spot on the totem pole of bourgeois life, a spot to which I have clung desperately ever since.</p> <p>No, I think of the guillotine because those summers and the years that followed taught me something about the changing nature of income inequality and class resentment. Back in 1978, when I made off with an Ivy League diploma, my first job paid less than I had been making opening doors and helping old ladies with their packages. Worse yet, it took me four years of full-time work before my white-collar wages exceeded what I would have earned in uniform back on East 69th Street. Even at that point, however, I was still in the hole. Think of all those semesters of forgone earnings. Think of the tuition, room, board and bookstore expenses. And think about the cost of all that capital.</p> <p>I have to acknowledge that in those days, I resented the wages of Teamsters and sanitation workers almost as much as I did hereditary wealth. Much has been written lately about the enormous earnings advantage conferred by a college education, but what's striking to me is that this advantage was once so scant. Thirty years ago, in fact, the economist Richard Freeman published a book called ''The Over-educated American,'' and although I was too young and stupid to realize it, I was one.</p> <p>It's true that I chose a line of work -- newspapers -- that is notorious for low entry-level wages, but the broader data bear me out. In 1978, men with a bachelor's degree had an estimated wage premium of just 21 percent over men who were high school graduates, according to ''The State of Working America 2004-2005'' by Lawrence Mishel, Jared Bernstein and Sylvia Allegretto.</p> <p>But in my case, even that modest premium was illusory. My new white-collar job required a car and crazy hours; there was little overtime pay. The progressive tax system probably further eroded the college premium, because higher earnings were subject to higher levies.</p> <p>In 2003, the most recent year for which the book contained data, the male college wage differential was 41.5 percent -- practically double what it was when I started out. Although it's possible that my current modest prosperity is entirely a result of good looks (that would account for why it's so modest), chances are that education played a big role in making me better off financially than the doormen among whom I once worked.</p> <p>In coming years, the earnings premium for educated Americans will probably increase because of factors like new technology, outsourcing, large numbers of unskilled immigrants and the tendency of the educated to marry one another. Within the economic arena, I doubt that much can be done about this differential.</p> <p>Today, it's doubtful that many college graduates would envy the pay and benefits of most blue-collar workers. Those who inherit money, meanwhile, can't be blamed for their own dumb luck. So most of us direct our class-based ire at what might be called the new earnings aristocracy. Consider Sanford I. Weill, the former Citigroup chairman, who made nearly $1 billion on the job yet still departs with an annual pension exceeding $1 million -- as well as medical and dental insurance. Or how about William W. McGuire, the chief executive of the UnitedHealth Group, who is reported by The Wall Street Journal to have $1.6 billion in unrealized gains on stock options when workers and employers are battling over who will pay for soaring medical premiums?</p> <p>THAT'S where the guillotine comes in. I'm not expecting anything like the French Revolution, of course. The guillotine I'm talking about is more figurative than literal. It could take the form of punitive marginal tax rates, new trade barriers or excessive regulation of private enterprise -- changes that will make everyone poorer.</p> <p>If those at the top of the heap are really so smart, they should start advocating some orderly increase in redistribution -- at the very least, in the form of national health coverage. They should do this if only to maintain social peace -- to prevent the less fortunate, in other words, from losing their heads. Because, if that happens, the rich may lose theirs as well.</p> <p>ON THE CONTRARY Daniel Akst is a journalist and novelist who writes often about business.

But now the Army, along with other branches of the armed services, is facing a serious recruiting gap that is forcing it to rethink its hiring practices and marketing strategy. The proposed changes in tactics outlined in an article in Monday's Times seem like a good start on what is likely to be a long and difficult effort to turn things around. As a collateral benefit, these changes may help society as well.</p> <p>Officials at the Pentagon offer several reasons for the declining lack of interest in military service. One is purely statistical. The pool of young men and women between the ages of 18 and 22, the optimum age for recruits, has shrunk to about 21 million, down 5 million from the 1980 level. Meanwhile, a robust economy has created abundant job opportunities for those who might otherwise be interested in enlisting, while making it financially feasible for more young people to attend college.</p> <p>There may also be more amorphous influences at work. Louis Caldera, the Secretary of the Army, notes that many of the parents of the present generation of recruits came of age after the draft ended in 1973, and thus have no tradition of military service to pass along to their offspring. Representative Steve Buyer, an Indiana Republican who heads the House subcommittee on military personnel, believes that the armed forces have never codified their basic mission since the end of the cold war and, under President Clinton, have begun to resemble an international fire brigade with poorly defined, helter-skelter responsibilities that might best be left to regional powers.</p> <p>Whatever the reason, the numbers are not good. When the fiscal year ends tomorrow, the Army will fall short of its goal for the second year in a row, signing up 7,000 fewer enlistees than the 74,500 it needs to maintain its force at current levels. The Air Force is expected to miss its target by a lesser amount and the Navy will just squeak by. Only the Marine Corps has kept pace. Like all the services, the Army has increased its advertising, raised its ''signing bonuses'' and increased its contribution to a recruit's post-military college tuition from $40,000 to $50,000. The Army has also sent young soldiers back into their neighborhoods to deliver pep talks to their civilian contemporaries.</p> <p>These tactics make sense, but the most promising strategy may lie, paradoxically, in the Pentagon's willingness to ease its standards. Under present rules, 90 percent of the Army's recruits must have at least a high school diploma. In recent years, however, the Army has found that recruits with lesser academic credentials like a general equivalency diploma -- G.E.D. for short -- have performed just as well as those with high school degrees. Thus, just as the Navy did last year, the Army is thinking of relaxing the 90 percent requirement, allowing more G.E.D. students into its ranks. It is also planning a pilot program that will pay 6,000 high school dropouts to pursue a G.E.D. so they can qualify to join the active force or the reserves. In a similar vein, the Army will try to sign up students who have started college but dropped out.</p> <p>In effect, the Army will increasingly be seeking its recruits among dropouts of one sort or another, as long as they possess or can be persuaded to obtain minimal credentials. This strategy could yield a double benefit. It could not only help the Army deal with its manpower problems but also give a new sense of direction to many thousands of young people who might otherwise wind up on the streets, unemployed or in dead-end service jobs.</p>",1141427,Shoring Up the Volunteer Army,,,,189,0,,,,690,Find documents which describe an advantage in hiring potential or increased income for graduates of U.S. colleges.,college education advantage

''Nothing, not a national election or a Washington snowstorm, should get in the way of making a college education more affordable for all Americans.''</p> <p>Mr. Clinton's announcement, like the health care measures he proposed on Wednesday, are part of a seasonal ritual in which the president tries to build interest in his State of the Union address, scheduled for next Thursday.</p> <p>Not all the details are announced early. Asked how the education proposals would be paid for, Joe Lockhart, a White House spokesman, told reporters to wait until next month, when the administration's spending priorities for the 2001 fiscal year are unveiled.</p> <p>At the president's side today were Hillary Rodham Clinton, who is seeking a Senate seat in New York, and Mr. Schumer, who had advocated making college tuition tax deductible in his victorious campaign over Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato in 1998.</p> <p>Mr. Clinton said the two had twisted his arm to include the education proposals in his 2001 budget.</p> <p>Introducing the president was Nina McLaughlin, a freshman at Trinity College in Washington, who said her family would significantly benefit from the proposals. Ms. McLaughlin has two younger brothers nearing college age. Her father is working overtime to pay for expenses, while her mother holds two jobs.</p> <p>Reminiscing about his own college days, Mr. Clinton said: ''I had the help of scholarships, loans and jobs. If I hadn't had that help, there's no way in the world I'd be standing here today.''</p>",1170209,President Proposes $31 Billion in Education Aid for Families,,,,190,0,,,,690,Find documents which describe an advantage in hiring potential or increased income for graduates of U.S. colleges.,college education advantage

The size of the benefit has gone up, too, to about $1,000 a month for a full-time student. As recently as 2000, the stipend was $650 a month, so officials hope the increase will be enough to get more veterans to go to class. Benefits for reservists and National Guardsmen have been raised from $288 a month to as much as $800, depending on how long they have been on active duty.</p> <p>Beyond that, the benefits have expanded to include forms of education that the framers of the original G.I. Bill could not have envisioned. Veterans can now get larger lump sums for costly short-term training in technology-intensive fields like aerospace, computers and biotechnology. Benefits also pay for tests required for a professional license or certificate in fields as diverse as plumbing and medicine.</p> <p>''While the veteran of the 1940's was going to school to get ahead of the curve,'' Mr. Douglass says, ''the veteran of today is doing it because he's just trying to keep pace.''</p> <p>COLLEGE AND MONEY</p>",1642208,From Combat To Campus On the G.I.

George Pataki is right to focus on containing them. But budget cuts cannot  cure a poorly designed system that not only encourages overspending with built-in conflicts of interest but also fails to comply with the law. Restructuring the system -- while avoiding Federal sanctions and costly lawsuits -- will require serious thought and careful coordination among school systems, local governments and the State Legislature.</p> <p>An obvious first step is to limit the influence of the special education lobby -- the nonprofit agencies that decide which children should enroll in special education classes and provide the special services those children receive.</p> <p>The special education program in New York State serves nearly 400,000 children, providing federally mandated instruction for students with physical, emotional or learning disabilities. The system has been sued for failing to provide instruction in a timely fashion as required by law and by longstanding consent decrees. It was recently sued again for maintaining special education preschoolers in segregated classes instead of mainstreaming them, as required by the Federal Individuals With Disabilities Education Act. The act requires grouping children with their nondisabled peers, and sending them out for periodic therapies.</p> <p>New York has two special education systems -- one for preschoolers, taught by private not-for-profit agencies, and one for kindergarten through 12th-grade students, operated by the school systems. The K-through-12 program costs the state $3.6 billion per year. Since 1980, the per pupil cost in the city has increased by 62 percent, as against only 7 percent for pupils in the general system.</p> <p>Preschool special education is less costly -- $700 million this year -- but is growing at four times the rate of the K-through-12 program. Part of this surge arises from changes in state and Federal law, which made special education for disabled 3- and 4-year-olds an entitlement. Other costs arise from the way New York does business.</p> <p>Most states have folded preschool special education into the public schools.  New York farms out its 3- and 4-year-olds to private agencies, which evaluate candidates for special education and sell the services those children receive. A report by the City Comptroller found that many preschool special education children get more services than their disabilities require, ""substantially increasing the cost of the program."" In addition, the report said, ""at least two-thirds of the children are enrolled in the same school that evaluated their  disability, a clear conflict of interest.""</p> <p>Further, the mainstreaming requirement in the disabilities act is routinely ignored. Although mainstreaming pupils with minor disabilities would be healthier and far less costly than the segregated approach, only 13.5 percent of New York's special education preschoolers are mainstreamed, as opposed to 57 percent for the country as a whole. The danger is that children who are classified disabled at age 3 will never escape the label or the special education program itself. The data provoked children's advocates to file yet another lawsuit.</p> <p>Public schools will eventually need to assume the tasks of screening and teaching preschool special education children. In a system that already has 100,000 fewer seats than students, that will mean building more schools. In the  meantime, the Legislature needs to take a leading role in restructuring the system. That means standing up to the special education lobby.</p>",859968,The Special Education Nightmare,,,,217,1,,,,379,Identify documents that discuss mainstreaming children with physical or mental impairments.,mainstreaming

Eastman Kodak hired him in 1991 to help create the first digital art center, the Center for Creative Imaging in Camden, Me. As a founding director, Mr. McBride helped develop a curriculum to educate artists in new imaging and multimedia technologies.</p> <p>After Kodak sold the center in 1993 to Brace Management, which subsequently folded it, Mr. McBride left to found United Digital Artists, a new-media agency in Manhattan that represents high-technology artists, as well as software programmers and technology consultants.</p> <p>The company's clients, who specialize in creating on-line services and interactive products like CD-ROM titles, multimedia games and interactive movies, have worked for big technology and media companies, including Apple Computer, CNN, Disney, Random House and Time Warner.</p> <p>Question. How does your company differ from traditional talent agencies?</p> <p>Answer. We broker creative talent, but we differ from the traditional publishing and entertainment models. We educate artists and clients about both the potential and limitations of new technology. And we put together the best imaginable teams of artists and programmers.</p> <p>Q. Sounds like you are creating a virtual corporation.</p> <p>A. The lifeblood of the industry is the independent artists and multimedia developers who still answer their own phones, don't get much sleep and are brilliant. They're the new-media garage bands.</p> <p>Q. When do you think interactivity will hit the popular culture?</p> <p>A. We're seeing a few best-selling interactive games and storybooks like ""Myst,"" ""Doom,"" ""Grandma and Me."" The numbers are still not close to what you get with a paperback best seller or box office hit. I like to think that will happen soon.</p> <p>Q. What aspect of the digital revolution is being overlooked?</p> <p>A. We need to remember that it's artists who create. Computers are just tools -- no more, no less inspired than Rembrandt's paintbrush.</p> <p>Q. What coming technologies are you waiting for?</p> <p>A. Many new media tools are still awfully clunky and awkward to use. I look forward to the day when digital tools are transparent and artists can collaborate on line.</p> <p>Q.

Previously this population had little, if any, vocational options other than sheltered workshops. Mr. McCarthy, while attesting to the benefits of supportive employment, raised many unresolved issues; eligibility, responsibility for implementation of job trainers and the acquisition of social skills that are necessary in order for mentally handicapped people to be successful in their employment situations.</p> <p>The Education for All Handicapped Children Act, Public Law 94-142, guarantees every handicapped child ''a free and appropriate education.'' What is a more appropriate education for a moderately mentally handicapped student than to learn those social and vocational skills necessary to enable him/her meaningful employment while living within the community?</p> <p>The student's school district should be the responsible party in facilitating this concept through the youngster's Individual Educational Plan. There should be no predetermined age at which this training starts. Districts should not be allowed to only begin this process when a student reaches late teens. (How is this individualized?) Presently, some districts have created segregated, simulated work environments. Very often students are relegated to these prevocational classes for up to five years before any real job situations occur. Students in these programs have no opportunity for the necessary acquisition of social skills because there is no contact with the mainstream population.</p> <p>As the parent of one such handicapped child, I have sought to enlighten my district as to my daughter's needs and its obligation. (Unfortunately this has to be accomplished through a long administrative hearing that will ultimately lead to Federal court.) My district's version of an appropriate IEP for my 15-year-old daughter contains no mainstreaming and no vocational training, in spite of the fact that she was successfully employed at the local Y.M.C.A. for the entire summer! This supportive employment was planned and implemented by a privately hired psychologist, job trainer, the enthusiastic staff of the Y and myself. The very institution (the public school) that should have provided this vital service played no role in this success story.</p> <p>Mr. McCarthy asked parents to help professionals in finding the answers to his questions. We have some. We know our handicapped children's capabilities, we have come to accept their limitations. What we cannot accept, however, is an antiquated system that prevents handicapped children from those services to which they are entitled!</p> <p>MARILEE SHANNON</p> <p>West Bay Shore</p>",331728,Synopsis of the Plight Of the Handicapped,,,,222,0,,,,379,Identify documents that discuss mainstreaming children with physical or mental impairments.,mainstreaming

Under the main agreement, approved at the 1992 Earth Summit here, Brazil was to provide just 10 percent of the $250 million.</p> <p>The pilot program, which pays for surveying the vast rain forest, has been the principal vehicle for marking off 40,000 square miles for Indian reservations.</p> <p>Surveying is seen as the first step toward protecting the Amazon from destruction by ranchers, loggers, farmers and miners.</p> <p>The Group of Seven money was also earmarked for promoting sustainable development, controlling deforestation and other objectives.</p> <p>In addition, the money would have helped pay for setting aside 10 percent of the rain forest, or 240,000 square miles, as national parks and ecologically protected areas. Amid much fanfare, Brazil's President, Fernando Henrique Cardoso, pledged to establish the protected areas on a visit to New York last April.</p> <p>Covering an area half as big as the continental United States, the Amazon is a lush laboratory of plants, animals and bacteria that contains more than 20 percent of the world's fresh water supply. Throughout much of the decade, as other countries criticized Brazil for failing to protect the rain forest, the Government insisted that wealthy nations pay to map it and to protect its resources. Officials also contended that the scale of the program was insufficient to the task.</p> <p>But environmentalists say that even that modest effort is now in jeopardy. Under pressure to rein in the budget deficit, Brazilian Government officials have slashed spending across the board. A recent agreement with the International Monetary Fund, which is heading a $41.3 billion standby loan for Brazil, reduces Government spending on environmental programs by two-thirds.</p> <p>Under the pilot program, the Brazilian Government provides matching funds and manpower to administer the Group of Seven grant. The Government's revised budget, made public in November, cuts the amount Brazil can expect to get from the group to $6.4 million from more than $61 million.</p> <p>''It is arguably a far more irrational and perverse consequence of the I.M.F. agreement than even the harshest critics of the I.M.F. could have imagined,'' said Stephan Schwartzman, a senior scientist at the Washington-based Environmental Defense Fund.</p> <p>Acre in western Brazil, one of the nine states covered by the rain forest, had developed a three-year program counting on some $5 million of the Group of Seven money to survey and zone its forest. Ninety percent of the cost is being underwritten by the group.</p> <p>''When it was all under way and ready to move forward -- boom -- the cuts came,'' said Maria Janet Santos, who is coordinating zoning for Acre's environmental protection agency. ''It really cuts into the credibility of what we're trying to do.''</p> <p>Congress is expected to vote on the budget by Jan. 15. Senator Marina Silva of the opposition Workers' Party said the Government had not ruled out restoring the environmental money if other cuts could be found.</p>",1073784,Brazil Slashes Money for Project Aimed at Protecting Amazon,,,,278,2,,,,400,What measures are being taken by local South American authorities to preserve the Amazon tropical rain forest?,Amazon rain forest

A coalition of ranchers and industrialists managed to strip the bill of some of its toughest provisions, and is trying to persuade Mr. Cardoso to veto the  important measures that remain. Before doing so, he should think carefully about a report issued last week by the Brazilian National Space Research Institute, which found that deforestation in Brazil's Amazon is growing alarmingly.</p> <p>Brazil has good laws on the books protecting the Amazon but no legal power to enforce them. The environmental agency can levy only absurdly small fines and collects less than 10 percent of them. The legislation passed last week to correct this has been sitting in Congress for seven years.</p> <p>At the top of the list of measures Mr. Cardoso should preserve is a requirement that companies pay the cost of cleaning up environmental damage they caused, even if the Government cannot prove the damage was intentional. Mr. Cardoso should also save a provision that prohibits proven polluters from getting Government contracts or bidding on Government loans for several years, and another measure setting daily fines for companies that refuse to clean up their damage.</p> <p>Enforcement of environmental laws is particularly crucial given the evidence that damage to the Amazon is rapidly worsening. This contributes to global warming and destroys a forest that houses the most diverse group of plants and animals in the world. The new report, which uses satellite data, found that clear-cutting has been rising at a rapid rate. The 1995-96 burning season saw 7,000 square miles destroyed, almost double the annual deforestation that took place four years earlier.</p> <p>The Amazon suffers from other damage not extensive enough to show up in satellite pictures, such as selective logging, fires and drying. A recent report by Brazil's Congress found that the total area affected annually is more than 22,000 square miles.  Another study, by the Woods Hole Research Institute in Massachusetts, found that cutting and burning have dried out the forest to the point that it could burn out of control. Brazil's deforestation is likely to rise as Asian logging companies move deeper into the Amazon. Mr. Cardoso must refrain from further weakening an already weak bill.</p>",992405,Half-Measures to Protect the Amazon,,,,280,0,,,,400,What measures are being taken by local South American authorities to preserve the Amazon tropical rain forest?,Amazon rain forest

The most viable solution, not yet presented, is economical and does not require dubious governmental intervention.</p> <p>The settlers are burning the Amazon forest because they need profits from farming and cattle raising on the cleared land. Those profits, unfortunately, are only temporary because of the nature of the fragile Amazon soil. The only alternative for these settlers is the development of the rain forest itself, i.e., the lumber industry.</p> <p>Selective tree cutting has never been and never will be a danger for the hardwood forest. For example, large hardwood European forests, where selective logging has been practiced more than two centuries, has resulted in larger oak forests today than 300 years ago. It should be noted that the rain forest cannot be reforested by planting, as practiced in the softwood forests worldwide.</p> <p>Why should selective cutting be implemented? The Amazonian forest contains 20 to 60 trees an acre, but only one or two can be used for industrial purposes.

The most viable solution, not yet presented, is economical and does not require dubious governmental intervention.</p> <p>The settlers are burning the Amazon forest because they need profits from farming and cattle raising on the cleared land. Those profits, unfortunately, are only temporary because of the nature of the fragile Amazon soil. The only alternative for these settlers is the development of the rain forest itself, i.e., the lumber industry.</p> <p>Selective tree cutting has never been and never will be a danger for the hardwood forest. For example, large hardwood European forests, where selective logging has been practiced more than two centuries, has resulted in larger oak forests today than 300 years ago. It should be noted that the rain forest cannot be reforested by planting, as practiced in the softwood forests worldwide.</p> <p>Why should selective cutting be implemented? The Amazonian forest contains 20 to 60 trees an acre, but only one or two can be used for industrial purposes. Only these trees can be felled economically because exploration requires heavy, expensive, high-oil-consumption equipment. This machinery can be amortized only by cutting large high-yield trees. The main advantage of selective cutting is that the younger trees get more access to light and water, accelerating the natural growth cycle of the forest.</p> <p>Lumber companies, together with settlers working for the industry, will preserve their source of supply through selective cutting, thus earning the most money per acre.</p> <p>The settlers will then become interested in forest preservation, that is, in not burning their source of supply and their working tools.

What stands in the way of so compelling a solution?</p> <p>Brazil owes the world $115 billion. The world wants Brazil to stop recklessly destroying the Amazon rain forest, an extraordinary natural wonder. Those two conditions invite a deal, a grand debt-for-nature swap that would ease Brazil's burden of foreign borrowing and preserve the Amazon forests. What stands in the way of so compelling a solution? Brazil's President, Jose Sarney, for one thing. Last month his Foreign Minister, Roberto de Abreu Sodre, received an American delegation that included Thomas Lovejoy, a tropical biologist, and Senators Tim Wirth, Albert Gore and John Heinz. Mr. Sodre enthusiastically endorsed the idea of a Brazilian foundation to administer a debt-for-nature swap. But when the group reached the presidential palace, Mr. Sarney rejected the idea as foreign interference. ''We don't want the Amazon to become a green Persian Gulf,'' he said.</p> <p>Mr. Sarney's notion of foreigners taking possession of the Amazon is a groundless fear concocted by his military advisers. His nonchalance toward the state of the forests does not accord with his own Government's data. Amazonia is fast being torched by landless settlers. The province of Rondonia, which holds one of the world's richest ecosystems, is already 17 percent deforested.</p> <p>The destruction is a bitter waste because the forest soil is for the most part too poor for farming. The settlers raise a few years' crops and then move on. Even cattle ranches are uneconomic and survive only through Government subsidies.</p> <p>Loss of the forests destroys both their Amerindian inhabitants and the livelihood of the rubber-tree tappers, who exploit the forest without destroying it. Last December the leader of the rubber tappers' union, Francisco Mendes Filho, was murdered after he campaigned to protect the rain forest from settlers' bulldozers. Despite death threats, the Government failed to protect him.</p> <p>How can Brazil's forests and their rich dowry of rare plants and animals be saved? The means are at hand in Brazil's debt. Suppose donors in the West could raise $4 billion to save the Amazonian rain forests. They would then buy discounted Brazilian debt with a face value of, say, $8 billion. That debt, denominated in dollars, is exchanged in Brazil for bonds worth $8 billion in local currency. The bonds are then donated to endow a Brazilian environmental institute charged with protecting the rain forest.</p> <p>Everyone would benefit because (a) the institute gets generous income from the interest and principal paid on the debt; (b) the Brazilian Government gets to pay off its debt in local currency instead of in scarce foreign exchange; (c) Brazil can then afford more imports from the donor countries; (d) creditor banks are relieved of dubious loans, and (e) an irreplaceable rain forest is saved for future generations.</p> <p>It's as much in the West's interest to help Brazil save Amazonia as it is in Brazil's. The forests are ancient nurseries of life where evolution has progressed for eons, uninterrupted by the ice ages that have periodically wiped out most species in temperate latitudes. The extensive burning of Amazonia adds greatly to the burden of carbon dioxide, cause of the feared greenhouse warming of the earth's atmosphere. Because aid can be so highly leveraged through debt exchange, the forests are cheap to save.</p> <p>As for Brazil, it would lighten its foreign debt burden by helping to save its own natural heritage. The clearer view of Brazilian interests comes from Mr. Sarney's Foreign Minister, not his generals.</p>",220124,Brazil's Debt Can Save the Amazon,,,,282,0,,,,400,What measures are being taken by local South American authorities to preserve the Amazon tropical rain forest?,Amazon rain forest

Only the occasional glassy expression, the naive preachiness, the supportive tittering by some of the cultists hinted at the underlying pathology that led such seemingly bright and articulate people to a tragic misjudgment.</p> <p>Some find it shocking that a technically gifted group, earning its keep by designing web sites for businesses, could fall prey to aberrational beliefs that blended far-out science fiction with elements of Christianity. Members concluded that the Comet Hale-Bopp was a ''marker'' signaling that their time had come, a celestial omen that may even have been hiding a giant spaceship behind it, poised to carry believers to the higher level from which some claim to have originated.</p> <p>But technical expertise is no proof against bizarre beliefs. Some of the most fervent believers in visits by alien spaceships and in versions of Creation that defy everything known to science have backgrounds in engineering or other technical subjects. Nor does a deep sense of spirituality protect cultists from suicidal acts that are condemned by most religions.</p> <p>Experts on cult behavior are already exploring what might have led this particular group to its carefully planned, artfully choreographed ending. They will be examining the dynamics of an isolated group, the backgrounds of its members, the allure of its leader and the role of the Internet and web browsers in spreading and reinforcing bizarre theories. Fans of the web resist any suggestion that instantaneous communications have enabled paranoiacs and conspiracy theorists to loft and expand their theories with warp speed. But events as serious as this one and as silly as the rantings of Pierre Salinger suggest that the web may exert a multiplier effect.</p> <p>There was an old-fashioned element to the psychiatric-spiritual saga of Bo and Peep, who mutated into Ti and Do and piped their wounded, foolish followers to early graves. This group, like others over the long course of human history, looked for its destiny in the heavens and found it in the rantings of a madman about a ball of dirty ice with a luminous tail, the Comet Hale-Bopp. As the world approaches a new millennium, a time when cosmic soul-searching intensifies, other groups will look skyward and some, alas, may seek salvation in acts the rest of us consider lunacy.</p> <p>Cults differ from mainstream faiths in their lack of ancient roots and their glorification of hubris. Resurrection, the meaninglessness of the flesh, the primacy of the spirit, the conversion from the physical to the heavenly plane are features of several faiths. But the crucial safety brake in most theologies is that the believer himself cannot choose the moment of ascension. Only the central deity can do that.</p> <p>The interesting thing about Branch Davidians, Jonestownsians and now the Heaven's Gaters is not so much their ad hoc mumbo-jumbo.

Paper, $23.95.</p> <p>A woman in the Islamic northern Sudan lives what appears to be a beleaguered life. Before she is 10, a midwife circumcises her, snipping off her clitoris and stitching together the outer labia. In her late teens, she beautifies herself for marriage by removing all her body hair and scraping off the outer layer of her skin. Reliably virginal at marriage, she is soon abandoned by her husband for most of the year - he works in the city, she remains in the village with the children. Her marriage, in these circumstances, is fragile. Men divorce easily for other women, or take other wives, particularly if the first is barren. Throughout life a woman is legally under the control of her father, her brothers and her husband, and her behavior is tightly regulated.</p> <p>But there are spirits who possess at least some of the women and force them into rude, wanton behavior. Such spirits attack fertility and cause illness. To cure herself, a possessed woman must appease the spirit through ceremonies in which the spirit descends into her and states its demands: new sandals, new clothes, a husband's acquiescence in a wife's desires. These women are then members of the Zar cult.</p> <p>In ''Wombs and Alien Spirits: Women, Men and the Zar Cult in Northern Sudan,'' Janice Boddy - a professor of anthropology at the University of Toronto - has written a traditional ethnography, complete with kinship diagrams, Arabic terms, and many, many facts. By the end of the book you feel that you know her community of women well. The primary impact of post-modernism in anthropology - apart from some silliness - has been to sharpen and sensitize the ethnographer's eye. Ms. Boddy's language and authorial self-description betray the strong influence of post-modern theory. That influence leads her not to repudiate the business of writing ethnography, but to be highly aware of the multiple purposes and meanings that these women give to their activities. Such alertness lets her provide a better analytic explanation of spirit possession than most.</p> <p>Many anthropologists would interpret a cult such as the Zar as the means through which subordinate individuals express their needs in public. Ms. Boddy argues that the cult does more, that it is the major form of symbolic play for these adults. The spirits that possess them are prostitutes, doctors, military men, gypsies, cannibalistic sorcerers and women of holiness and purity - a range of northern Sudanese cultural characters. This vividly imagined other world, Ms. Boddy argues, is in itself esthetically and creatively rewarding. And through the variety of these self-representations, the cult enables its women to reflect upon their actual world, so that the spirit possession becomes almost a satiric commentary upon their experience of the feminine.

Reliably virginal at marriage, she is soon abandoned by her husband for most of the year - he works in the city, she remains in the village with the children. Her marriage, in these circumstances, is fragile. Men divorce easily for other women, or take other wives, particularly if the first is barren. Throughout life a woman is legally under the control of her father, her brothers and her husband, and her behavior is tightly regulated.</p> <p>But there are spirits who possess at least some of the women and force them into rude, wanton behavior. Such spirits attack fertility and cause illness. To cure herself, a possessed woman must appease the spirit through ceremonies in which the spirit descends into her and states its demands: new sandals, new clothes, a husband's acquiescence in a wife's desires. These women are then members of the Zar cult.</p> <p>In ''Wombs and Alien Spirits: Women, Men and the Zar Cult in Northern Sudan,'' Janice Boddy - a professor of anthropology at the University of Toronto - has written a traditional ethnography, complete with kinship diagrams, Arabic terms, and many, many facts. By the end of the book you feel that you know her community of women well. The primary impact of post-modernism in anthropology - apart from some silliness - has been to sharpen and sensitize the ethnographer's eye. Ms. Boddy's language and authorial self-description betray the strong influence of post-modern theory. That influence leads her not to repudiate the business of writing ethnography, but to be highly aware of the multiple purposes and meanings that these women give to their activities. Such alertness lets her provide a better analytic explanation of spirit possession than most.</p> <p>Many anthropologists would interpret a cult such as the Zar as the means through which subordinate individuals express their needs in public. Ms. Boddy argues that the cult does more, that it is the major form of symbolic play for these adults. The spirits that possess them are prostitutes, doctors, military men, gypsies, cannibalistic sorcerers and women of holiness and purity - a range of northern Sudanese cultural characters. This vividly imagined other world, Ms. Boddy argues, is in itself esthetically and creatively rewarding. And through the variety of these self-representations, the cult enables its women to reflect upon their actual world, so that the spirit possession becomes almost a satiric commentary upon their experience of the feminine. Through imaginatively playing at being other, the author suggests, these women become more adept at imagining themselves.</p> <p>''Wombs and Alien Spirits'' is long and at times repetitive and overwritten. Yet much of it is fluent and vivid, and it left me intrigued.</p>",337774,WOMEN POSSESSED,,,,9,2,,,,325,Describe a cult by name and identify the cult members' activities in their everyday life.,Cult Lifestyles

""Locked-Up Time"" is an eloquent film that shows what an abstraction like ""politics"" did to one woman and her family.</p> <p>LOCKED-UP TIME  Directed by Sibylle Schonemann (in German with English subtitles); director of photography, Thomas Plenert; edited by Gudrun Steinbruck; music by Thomas Kahane; produced by Bernd Burkhardt and Alfred Hurmer. At Alice Tully Hall as part of the 29th New York Film Festival. Running time: 90 minutes.

Six cult members were also killed, and a standoff with the authorities began that ended 51 days later when fire broke out as tanks operated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation pumped tear gas into the compound.</p> <p>The defendants are also accused of setting the April 19 fire that destroyed their compound. The bodies of the cult's leader, David Koresh, and 80 of his followers were found in the rubble.</p> <p>On Thursday, the medical examiner who investigated the deaths, Nizam Peerwani of Fort Worth, testified that Mr. Koresh, 33, died from a single gunshot wound to the center of the forehead. His chief lieutenant, Steve Schneider, died near him, from a gunshot wound in the mouth. Seventeen other sect members died of gunshots, including five children. At least one woman was shot in the back and a 2-year-old boy died of a single stab wound to the left side of his chest.</p> <p>Dr. Peerwani, who led teams performing autopsies, said 36 corpses, including those of all of the children found, were discovered inside a concrete bunker in the compound.</p> <p>Most of those in the concrete bunker died of smoke inhalation or suffocation, but several were killed when the bunker's roof collapsed, Dr. Peerwani said.</p> <p>Arson investigators used charts and videotapes to support prosecutors' assertions that the Branch Davidians themselves started the fire, but the defense quickly counterattacked.</p> <p>William Cass, a senior arson specialist with the Los Angeles Fire Department, testified that a four-member group led by an arson expert, Paul Gray of Houston, had determined that the fires started simultaneously in three sections of the compound.</p> <p>A videotape of the fire, taken by a Government plane, shows heat patterns erupting in the compound's southernmost corner on the second floor, then the chapel area, and finally the dining room. The corner fire started 90 seconds after the video shows an F.B.I. tank smashing into the area.</p> <p>Investigators say that in 10 minutes the fire grew into a fireball because of the wooden building's poor construction and because the debris from the tanks' battering fed the flames.</p> <p>But defense lawyers contend the fire started some time earlier, in the gymnasium, when the tanks knocked over gas lanterns that cult members had scattered throughout the compound.  Under cross-examination, Mr. Cass acknowledged that the prosecution's videotape showed a heat ""flash spot"" erupting near the gymnasium before the three heat spots the arson investigators had noted.</p> <p>Mr. Cass said the panel did not watch this section of the videotape because they searched for clues to the fire's ignition only in those areas where witnesses had reported seeing flames or smoke. Nor, he said, did the experts see F.B.I. logs in which observers note an earlier fire in the gymnasium. Mr. Gray did not show those logs to the other fire investigators, Mr. Cass said.</p> <p>""This is the first time I've ever seen them,"" he testified.

The Irish Vote Next</p> <p>Mr. Major met in Rio today with Prime Minister Albert Reynolds of Ireland, which will vote in a referendum on the treaty next Thursday. In the first national referendum on the treaty, held last week in Denmark, voters narrowly voted against it.</p> <p>All the major Irish political parties have asked voters to support the treaty, just as most of the major Danish political parties had. But if the Irish voters also reject it, most other Europeans agree, the Maastricht Treaty will be a dead letter. It cannot go into effect unless it is ratified by all 12 European Community members.</p> <p>Mr. Major suspended debate on ratification in Britain after the Danish surprise.</p> <p>Over the past week, his aides have suggested that one way to improve the chances of ratification everywhere would be to negotiate an additional protocol putting limits on the powers of the community bureaucracy in Brussels to legislate details of ordinary life.  Butterfat and Beer</p> <p>Some support for this idea has been reported in Germany as well. And in France, where President Francois Mitterrand said last week that he would submit the treaty to a referendum this year, the upper house of the legislature voted today to make it easier to challenge directives from Brussels.</p> <p>Directives from community headquarters telling French farmers that they have to pasteurize Camembert, British farmers that they leave too much butterfat in clotted cream and German brewers that they cannot keep chemical stabilizers out of beer have all revived doubts about the benefits of ever greater unity and standardization.</p> <p>Emotions about national sovereignty run high in Britain and in Denmark. Here, the concern centers around the fate of Germany's economic stability, of which the cornerstone, as Germans see it, is the mark.</p> <p>The warning published today by the German economists, including many well-known pro-Europeans, said that the goal of economic unity was a respectable one but that the Maastricht Treaty's provisions for establishing a common European currency by the end of the decade would not work.

The tangible benefits of being admitted into the charmed circle may be debatable, but being left out is hell.</p> <p>''It is already a negative thing to be out of the 11,'' said Dimitri Papadimoulis, spokesman for the Coalition of the Left, an opposition party. ''But if we stay out after 2001 the cost will be painful. Now we are the European country in the Balkans. Then we would be another Balkan country in the Balkans.''</p> <p>With the devaluation in March of the drachma by 14 percent -- the Greek currency is now part of a European exchange rate structure that is a prerequisite for future euro members -- the Simitis Government is convinced that Greece is on its way.</p> <p>According to Finance Minister Yiannos Papantoniou, Greece has accepted prodding from its European partners to do in 18 months what it had already promised to do in three years: tackle its bloated public sector with the privatization of 11 publicly held companies, including several state banks, by the end of 1999.</p> <p>''We have a mutual interest in succeeding,'' Mr. Papantoniou said, speaking of Greece's pledges to the other members of the European Union. ''At this point, I don't see major risks. We are on the right way.''</p> <p>But here and in the rest of Europe, there is some lingering skepticism about the ability of the Simitis Government -- heir to the left-wing political machine built by the late Andreas Papandreou -- to meet the harsh criteria set down for euro membership, and survive politically.</p> <p>As the poorest country in the European Union, with a per capita gross domestic product half that of Germany, an economy that is even more dependent on a corrupt and inefficient public sector than many ex-Communist countries, and a reputation for squandering European Union subsidies, Greece's chances of meeting the monetary union's criteria are far from guaranteed.</p> <p>''The next two years are going to be critical,'' said Costas Stambolis, editor of an economic newsletter. ''The Government will have to undertake wage freezes, a shrinking of the public sector, restructuring. It will create a lot of unrest, and they will have to cope with it.''</p> <p>The devaluation of the drachma, considered inevitable by many analysts, was presented, and for the most part received, as a bold and confident sign of the Government's commitment to Europe. The Athens stock market soared, while foreign investors were cheered by the Government's tough-talking pledges to move swiftly ahead with privatization and hold down public spending.</p> <p>But critics have since found reason to worry. Initially at least, the devaluation has put Greece, if anything, further away from the fiscal goals set for euro membership. In a country heavily dependent on imports, devaluation has led to a slight surge in inflation, and a slowing of the decrease in public debt, much of which is held in foreign currencies.</p> <p>Mostly, the doubts have to do with the Government's ability to follow through on its promises. ''Verbally they are doing extremely well,'' said Stefanos Manos, a former Finance Minister. ''But I am not convinced this Government will reach the euro criteria in time. The social base that elects this Government is in the public sector. Simitis will not cut off the branch he is sitting on.''</p> <p>The Simitis Government has scored notable successes in bringing its fiscal affairs in order.

Then we would be another Balkan country in the Balkans.''</p> <p>With the devaluation in March of the drachma by 14 percent -- the Greek currency is now part of a European exchange rate structure that is a prerequisite for future euro members -- the Simitis Government is convinced that Greece is on its way.</p> <p>According to Finance Minister Yiannos Papantoniou, Greece has accepted prodding from its European partners to do in 18 months what it had already promised to do in three years: tackle its bloated public sector with the privatization of 11 publicly held companies, including several state banks, by the end of 1999.</p> <p>''We have a mutual interest in succeeding,'' Mr. Papantoniou said, speaking of Greece's pledges to the other members of the European Union. ''At this point, I don't see major risks. We are on the right way.''</p> <p>But here and in the rest of Europe, there is some lingering skepticism about the ability of the Simitis Government -- heir to the left-wing political machine built by the late Andreas Papandreou -- to meet the harsh criteria set down for euro membership, and survive politically.</p> <p>As the poorest country in the European Union, with a per capita gross domestic product half that of Germany, an economy that is even more dependent on a corrupt and inefficient public sector than many ex-Communist countries, and a reputation for squandering European Union subsidies, Greece's chances of meeting the monetary union's criteria are far from guaranteed.</p> <p>''The next two years are going to be critical,'' said Costas Stambolis, editor of an economic newsletter. ''The Government will have to undertake wage freezes, a shrinking of the public sector, restructuring. It will create a lot of unrest, and they will have to cope with it.''</p> <p>The devaluation of the drachma, considered inevitable by many analysts, was presented, and for the most part received, as a bold and confident sign of the Government's commitment to Europe. The Athens stock market soared, while foreign investors were cheered by the Government's tough-talking pledges to move swiftly ahead with privatization and hold down public spending.</p> <p>But critics have since found reason to worry. Initially at least, the devaluation has put Greece, if anything, further away from the fiscal goals set for euro membership. In a country heavily dependent on imports, devaluation has led to a slight surge in inflation, and a slowing of the decrease in public debt, much of which is held in foreign currencies.</p> <p>Mostly, the doubts have to do with the Government's ability to follow through on its promises. ''Verbally they are doing extremely well,'' said Stefanos Manos, a former Finance Minister. ''But I am not convinced this Government will reach the euro criteria in time. The social base that elects this Government is in the public sector. Simitis will not cut off the branch he is sitting on.''</p> <p>The Simitis Government has scored notable successes in bringing its fiscal affairs in order. Inflation, which was in the double digits a few years ago, was down to 4.3 percent in February, while Greece's budget deficit, which was at an all-European high of 13.9 percent in 1993, had fallen to 4.2 percent in 1997, on its way to the 3 percent level set for entry into the euro.</p> <p>But many analysts see the final test of Greece's eligibility to join the euro -- to take place in the summer of 2000 -- as one that is as political as it is economic.</p> <p>''If we don't make it by 2001, we will never make it, and Greece will be pushed out of Europe,'' Mr. Manos said. ''Greece will have proved itself to be too different from the rest of Europe.''</p>",1006740,Joining Euro A Dim Hope For Greece,,,,69,2,,,,378,"Identify documents that discuss opposition to the use of the euro, the European currency.",euro opposition

We look upon the next 10 days with fear.'' On Sunday, voters in two important townships currently controlled by the opposition are supposed to go to the polls to elect new representatives to the Zimbabwean Parliament. In a news conference today in Harare, opposition leaders showed reporters copies of the government's voter rolls, and said that dozens of people on the lists did not exist. Government officials dismissed those charges. Monday will mark the deadline set by the opposition for Mr. Mugabe to accept and begin addressing a list of 15 demands, including disbanding government militias, restoring freedom of the press and releasing all political prisoners. Mr. Mugabe, who has governed Zimbabwe since the end of white-minority rule more than 20 years ago, played down the impact of the strike and dismissed his opponents' demands, saying he would not obey ''pathetic puppets'' of the West.

That would, by extension, include the kind of cooperation necessary for European integration to succeed.</p> <p>Mr. Blair's spokesman, Alastair Campbell, gave advance details of the speech as part of an effort by the Blair government to soften British opposition to the euro in a country where opinion surveys show that more than two thirds of people still oppose the project.</p> <p>But Mr. Blair is expected to say  that the history of Britain's postwar relationship with continental Europe has been one of missed opportunities, caused by the timidity of politicians fearful of an anti-European backlash among their own voters.</p> <p>In effect, Mr. Blair is hoping that the impetus and lessons of his diplomacy as America's junior partner in the war in Afghanistan will carry over to his pro-European agenda.  But such are the sensitivities in Britain about the European Union that the speech will not mark the beginning of a headlong British rush into membership of the euro, Mr. Campbell said. And British officials were careful today to reject the idea that the speech will mark the beginning of a campaign by Mr. Blair to press for a referendum on the issue.</p> <p>''What he's not saying is that you join the single currency come what may,'' Mr. Campbell said. ''What he's saying is that we must take decisions in our own national interest and our interest is in being a strong player in Europe.''</p> <p>All but Britain, Sweden and Denmark among the European Union's 15 members subscribe to the single currency, which came into being in electronic transactions on Jan. 1, 1999, but which will become legal tender in most of Western Europe's stores, supermarkets, pocketbooks and pay packets on Jan. 1, 2002.</p> <p>Britain has declined to join since the single currency was first mooted almost a decade ago and the issue has become one of the most divisive.

Millions of supports, also known as wrist managers, have been sold. More than a million of the Pro Flex model alone have been sold since 1989, including half amillion this year. The company expects to sell a half million more in 1993. WHY: In 1990 the Bureau of Labor Statistics estimated that of the 46 million Americans using computer keyboards, more than 180,000 suffered from wrist or hand injuries linked to repetitive tasks like typing. The most serious repetitive stress injury, or R.S.I., is carpal tunnel syndrome, a swelling of nerves where they pass through the wrists. That can cause crippling pain, weakness, numbness or tingling in the hands or wrists. Less troubling injuries include a variety of inflammation and swelling problems.</p> <p>WHO NEEDS IT?: You, possibly. In this age of the ubiquitous computer keyboard, the average data-entry office worker will flex his wrists about 5,000 times a day. ""They have become occupational athletes,"" said Paula Newman, a spokeswoman for Ergodyne. WHO ELSE?: Actual athletes, like bowlers, bicyclists, tennis players, golfers and softball players, as well as workers involved in tasks like meat-cutting, operating a cash register, dealing cards or working on an assembly line. ""Basically, anyone who is involved with picking, packing or plucking,"" Ms. Newman said. HOW IT WORKS: Wraps around the wrist with Velcro-like fasteners (Ergodyne's name for hook and loop fasteners is Aplix) and across the palm between the thumb and index finger. The device is designed to keep the wrist straight without immobilizing it. Most older wrist supports contained hard plastic splints and sometimes laced up the forearm like a corset. The Pro Flex has flexible steel stays encased in two synthetic materials, Vinaguard and Ultrilure, that give it as much support as a hard wrist support but increased movement and comfort. WHERE TO BUY IT: See the ergonomic experts where you work. Most Pro Flex supports are sold to them in bulk by safety equipment distributors, but they are also available in some hardware stores and home centers under the Safety Maid label. Average cost: $20. FASHION FACTS: Sizes range from X-Small to X-Large, but there are only two color schemes: tan with navy or black with silver. There are no plans for pastel, fluorescent or leather models, although there have been requests. Ergodyne can customize its wrist supports with logos, company colors, reflective tape or employee numbers. THE REST OF THE LINE: Ergodyne sells matching back supports, foot rests, computer keyboard wrist rests, tennis elbow supports, hand exercisers and anti-vibration gloves (for jack-hammer operators).</p> <p>THING</p>",572210,Wrist Support,,,,99,1,,,,350,Is it hazardous to the health of individuals to work with computer terminals on a daily basis?,Health and Computer Terminals

""Basically, anyone who is involved with picking, packing or plucking,"" Ms. Newman said. HOW IT WORKS: Wraps around the wrist with Velcro-like fasteners (Ergodyne's name for hook and loop fasteners is Aplix) and across the palm between the thumb and index finger. The device is designed to keep the wrist straight without immobilizing it. Most older wrist supports contained hard plastic splints and sometimes laced up the forearm like a corset. The Pro Flex has flexible steel stays encased in two synthetic materials, Vinaguard and Ultrilure, that give it as much support as a hard wrist support but increased movement and comfort. WHERE TO BUY IT: See the ergonomic experts where you work. Most Pro Flex supports are sold to them in bulk by safety equipment distributors, but they are also available in some hardware stores and home centers under the Safety Maid label. Average cost: $20. FASHION FACTS: Sizes range from X-Small to X-Large, but there are only two color schemes: tan with navy or black with silver. There are no plans for pastel, fluorescent or leather models, although there have been requests.

Families making below $100,000 a year would receive the full benefits of the proposals, while those with incomes up to $120,000 would receive reduced benefits.</p> <p>The proposals would expand, but not replace, existing education tax credits and scholarships, which Congress enacted in 1997 at Mr. Clinton's request.</p> <p>The initiatives face an uncertain prospect in this election year, with Republicans in Congress hesitant to give Mr. Clinton any political advantage. A more ambitious tax cut package pushed by Senators Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, and Olympia J.

D'Amato in 1998.</p> <p>Mr. Clinton said the two had twisted his arm to include the education proposals in his 2001 budget.</p> <p>Introducing the president was Nina McLaughlin, a freshman at Trinity College in Washington, who said her family would significantly benefit from the proposals. Ms. McLaughlin has two younger brothers nearing college age. Her father is working overtime to pay for expenses, while her mother holds two jobs.</p> <p>Reminiscing about his own college days, Mr. Clinton said: ''I had the help of scholarships, loans and jobs. If I hadn't had that help, there's no way in the world I'd be standing here today.''</p>",1170209,President Proposes $31 Billion in Education Aid for Families,,,,190,0,,,,690,Find documents which describe an advantage in hiring potential or increased income for graduates of U.S. colleges.,college education advantage

The Irish Vote Next</p> <p>Mr. Major met in Rio today with Prime Minister Albert Reynolds of Ireland, which will vote in a referendum on the treaty next Thursday. In the first national referendum on the treaty, held last week in Denmark, voters narrowly voted against it.</p> <p>All the major Irish political parties have asked voters to support the treaty, just as most of the major Danish political parties had. But if the Irish voters also reject it, most other Europeans agree, the Maastricht Treaty will be a dead letter. It cannot go into effect unless it is ratified by all 12 European Community members.</p> <p>Mr. Major suspended debate on ratification in Britain after the Danish surprise.</p> <p>Over the past week, his aides have suggested that one way to improve the chances of ratification everywhere would be to negotiate an additional protocol putting limits on the powers of the community bureaucracy in Brussels to legislate details of ordinary life.  Butterfat and Beer</p> <p>Some support for this idea has been reported in Germany as well. And in France, where President Francois Mitterrand said last week that he would submit the treaty to a referendum this year, the upper house of the legislature voted today to make it easier to challenge directives from Brussels.</p> <p>Directives from community headquarters telling French farmers that they have to pasteurize Camembert, British farmers that they leave too much butterfat in clotted cream and German brewers that they cannot keep chemical stabilizers out of beer have all revived doubts about the benefits of ever greater unity and standardization.</p> <p>Emotions about national sovereignty run high in Britain and in Denmark. Here, the concern centers around the fate of Germany's economic stability, of which the cornerstone, as Germans see it, is the mark.</p> <p>The warning published today by the German economists, including many well-known pro-Europeans, said that the goal of economic unity was a respectable one but that the Maastricht Treaty's provisions for establishing a common European currency by the end of the decade would not work.  Strong Words of Warning</p> <p>Trying too early to set up a common currency, the economists' statement said, could end up dividing Europe into economically weak and strong zones, rather than further uniting it, and could lead to higher inflation.</p> <p>""The hasty introduction of a European currency union will expose Western Europe to powerful economic tensions that could lead in the foreseeable future to a political confrontation, and thus endanger the goal of unity,"" the manifesto warned.</p> <p>One of the signers, Karl Schiller, a former Economics Minister, said in an interview: ""The debate in Germany on this has been very shallow up to now. I'm afraid that by pushing too soon for monetary union we would dig a ditch between the Western countries and others, like Finland, Poland and Czechoslovakia, who hope to become members of the European Community.""</p> <p>Germany's Parliament is expected to ratify the treaty, though it will take a two-thirds majority of both houses, including the one representing the states, where the governing Christian Democrats do not have a majority. If the states' interests are not adequately taken care of, said Florian Gerster, the European minister of the state of Rhineland-Palatinate, ""the consent of the states to the Maastricht Treaty remains uncertain.""</p> <p>Britain's House of Commons gave preliminary approval to the treaty last month, despite a score of defections from Conservative ranks, but the opposition Labor Party asked its members to abstain then. Now, according to Labor's deputy leader, Roy Hattersley, the party may oppose the treaty unless Mr. Major compromises with the other 11 members on coordinating labor policies.</p>",535460,Some Germans and Britons Grow Skittish Over Unity Treaty,,,,67,2,,,,378,"Identify documents that discuss opposition to the use of the euro, the European currency.",euro opposition

On Tuesday, Michael Howard, the Conservative leader, urged Britons to choose ''a better way'' because Mr. Blair's government had ''lost the plot.''</p> <p>May 5 had long been talked about as the most likely day for a contest that will be fought over issues ranging from the war in Iraq to the economy and public services, particularly education, police action against crime and the services offered by the National Health Service.</p> <p>''Our mission will be driven by values,'' Mr. Blair declared after visiting Buckingham Palace to seek Queen Elizabeth II's agreement to dissolve Parliament -- a ceremonial step opening what is sure to be a fierce campaign.</p> <p>A central argument for Mr. Blair is likely to be that Labor has managed the British economy well and still has work to do. ''This is the time to keep the progress going, move the country forward,'' he said in Dorset in southwest England in his first campaign appearance.</p> <p>Many political analysts in Britain have argued that Mr. Blair is virtually assured of victory because it would take an enormous swing toward the Conservatives to wipe out his commanding majority of around 160 seats in the 646-seat Parliament.</p> <p>But opinion surveys published in three newspapers on Tuesday showed Labor leading by only two to three percentage points, while a fourth poll based on the views of people who say they are certain of voting actually gave the Conservatives a 5-point lead.</p> <p>Since the British electoral system favors Labor's urban power base, even a margin of that magnitude would not translate into a Conservative majority at the polls. But if Mr. Blair's majority is seriously eroded, he could be viewed as a lame duck leader -- particularly because he has said he will not seek a fourth term. That, British political analysts maintain, would probably hasten his handing the torch to Gordon Brown, the chancellor of the exchequer and Mr. Blair's longstanding rival within the Labor Party.</p> <p>Another big challenge for Mr. Blair is to overcome voter apathy after two elections that gave him landslide majorities in the eight years since he first won power in 1997. To do that, he suggested Tuesday, he will embark on a personal campaign to try to restore the inspirational aura that surrounded his first few years as prime minister.</p> <p>He spoke of ''a belief that we should create a country where regardless of someone's class or background or race, or color or religion, they get the chance to make the most of themselves, to develop their potential to the full. And through them, the country gets its chance to develop its potential.''</p> <p>''So it's a big choice. It's a big decision,'' Mr. Blair said. ''The British people are the boss, and they are the ones that will make it.''</p> <p>Mr. Howard, the opposition leader, told his supporters that Mr. Blair was ''already secretly grinning about the prospect of his third victory.''</p> <p>''Well,'' he said, ''you don't have to settle for that.''</p>",1662787,Blair Calls Election for May 5 as His Party Slips in Polls,,,,70,0,,,,378,"Identify documents that discuss opposition to the use of the euro, the European currency.",euro opposition
