56.2,2,578,"<p>The earnest figures speaking to us from the videotape are haunting in their gentleness, their sincerity, their hapless desire to have us understand that they were not crazy people, not in the clutches of some messianic madman, not the least bit nervous about their freely made decision to commit collective suicide, or, as they would put it, leave the physical ''containers'' they had been wearing and ascend to the Level Above Human. Only the occasional glassy expression, the naive preachiness, the supportive tittering by some of the cultists hinted at the underlying pathology that led such seemingly bright and articulate people to a tragic misjudgment.</p> <p>Some find it shocking that a technically gifted group, earning its keep by designing web sites for businesses, could fall prey to aberrational beliefs that blended far-out science fiction with elements of Christianity. Members concluded that the Comet Hale-Bopp was a ''marker'' signaling that their time had come, a celestial omen that may even have been hiding a giant spaceship behind it, poised to carry believers to the higher level from which some claim to have originated.</p> <p>But technical expertise is no proof against bizarre beliefs. Some of the most fervent believers in visits by alien spaceships and in versions of Creation that defy everything known to science have backgrounds in engineering or other technical subjects. Nor does a deep sense of spirituality protect cultists from suicidal acts that are condemned by most religions.</p> <p>Experts on cult behavior are already exploring what might have led this particular group to its carefully planned, artfully choreographed ending. They will be examining the dynamics of an isolated group, the backgrounds of its members, the allure of its leader and the role of the Internet and web browsers in spreading and reinforcing bizarre theories. Fans of the web resist any suggestion that instantaneous communications have enabled paranoiacs and conspiracy theorists to loft and expand their theories with warp speed. But events as serious as this one and as silly as the rantings of Pierre Salinger suggest that the web may exert a multiplier effect.</p> <p>There was an old-fashioned element to the psychiatric-spiritual saga of Bo and Peep, who mutated into Ti and Do and piped their wounded, foolish followers to early graves. This group, like others over the long course of human history, looked for its destiny in the heavens and found it in the rantings of a madman about a ball of dirty ice with a luminous tail, the Comet Hale-Bopp. As the world approaches a new millennium, a time when cosmic soul-searching intensifies, other groups will look skyward and some, alas, may seek salvation in acts the rest of us consider lunacy.</p> <p>Cults differ from mainstream faiths in their lack of ancient roots and their glorification of hubris. Resurrection, the meaninglessness of the flesh, the primacy of the spirit, the conversion from the physical to the heavenly plane are features of several faiths. But the crucial safety brake in most theologies is that the believer himself cannot choose the moment of ascension. Only the central deity can do that.</p> <p>The interesting thing about Branch Davidians, Jonestownsians and now the Heaven's Gaters is not so much their ad hoc mumbo-jumbo. It is instead the centrality of the cult figure who manages to convince the weak and wounded that he or she has acquired the godlike power to set the date and destination of life's last journey.</p>",918882,Gateway to Madness,7,2,325,Describe a cult by name and identify the cult members' activities in their everyday life.,Cult Lifestyles,../crowdsourcing_data/Pilot_2P-OrdPar-NoHigh//f1202122_anonymized,"Counter({'s7': 13, 's6': 10, 's3': 9, 's1': 9, 's4': 9, 's2': 8, 's5': 7})",65,7,15,0.6336282140123306,"Counter({'s7': 0.9110696974021086, 's6': 0.6990568289541305, 's4': 0.6730489590840908, 's3': 0.6451625494784127, 's1': 0.6403451505892548, 's2': 0.5667067872290962, 's5': 0.5159472180506786})",0.5865830791690916,"Counter({'s7': 0.8666666666666667, 's6': 0.6666666666666666, 's3': 0.6, 's1': 0.6, 's4': 0.6, 's2': 0.5333333333333333, 's5': 0.4666666666666667})",0.9110696974021086,0.0,2.0,1.0,1.0
183.66666666666666,2,481,"<p>Fifty-three more bodies were discovered today crammed into a small pit inside the house of a Ugandan cult leader. A total of 81 bodies have been found in the pit in the past two days, 48 of them those of children.</p> <p>With each day bringing new horror in one of the largest mass murders in recent history, the police said tonight they believed they had found yet another mass grave at a building about 50 miles south of here, in the southwest of Uganda. Excavation will begin on Thursday morning, the police said. But even before that work begins, the death toll already stands at more than 600.</p> <p>Here at the home of an excommunicated priest, Father Dominic Kataribabo, investigators unearthed 74 bodies in the backyard on Monday. On Tuesday and today, 81 bodies were found inside the indoor pit, covered over with concrete, in one of the stone house's 10 rooms.</p> <p>The space for so many corpses was incredibly small. The pit, lined with banana leaves, was just six feet deep and five feet square, and the corpses were packed together in a dense, interlocking heap.</p> <p>Since Feb. 17, at least 654 bodies have been recovered in the wreckage of a cult, the Movement for the Restoration of the Ten Commandments of God, that splintered off from the Roman Catholic Church. The group demanded strict adherence to the Ten Commandments, required members to sell off their possessions and preached that the world would end on Dec. 31, 1999.</p> <p>The police originally suspected mass suicide when more than 300 followers burned to death in a church in the town of Kanungu, less than 50 miles from here. But since then, more bodies have been found with unmistakable signs of strangulation -- some by rope or banana leaves, others by hand. Many bodies have shown no signs of violence, leading some investigators to suspect mass poisoning.</p> <p>More and more, the police are calling this an organized slaughter, though they have not speculated publicly about how so many people could have been killed or how many executioners would have been involved.</p> <p>The scene at the house here today was particularly wrenching because so many bodies of children were found. Workers wearing rubber gloves pulled out the bodies one by one and laid them in a row on the lawn for a quick examination by a police pathologist. Then they were dragged to the rear of the compound to be buried in a long trench with the other bodies.</p> <p>Tonight, the police gave no details about the sight they intend to search tomorrow, except that it is in a village called Kabira, at a place where they said cult members often stayed overnight.</p> <p>A police spokesman, Mugenyi Assuman, said investigators also expected to take soil samples from various places where bodies have been found.</p>",1187935,Cult Toll Rises In Uganda As More Dead Are Found,8,1,325,Describe a cult by name and identify the cult members' activities in their everyday life.,Cult Lifestyles,../crowdsourcing_data/Pilot_2P-OrdPar-NoHigh//f1202122_anonymized,"Counter({'s5': 12, 's1': 11, 's6': 10, 's9': 9, 's3': 8, 's7': 7, 's8': 6, 's2': 6, 's4': 5, 's10': 2, 'none': 1})",77,11,15,0.5270448393139325,"Counter({'s5': 0.8275041803460149, 's1': 0.7352318453629096, 's6': 0.7087011596814773, 's9': 0.6382317809367639, 's3': 0.5091705321078903, 's7': 0.4612531535768434, 's8': 0.4563338619200891, 's2': 0.438197423809164, 's4': 0.3638544260475761, 's10': 0.1540644550704869, 'none': 0.04885216792014701})",0.5022639169492795,"Counter({'s5': 0.8, 's1': 0.7333333333333333, 's6': 0.6666666666666666, 's9': 0.6, 's3': 0.5333333333333333, 's7': 0.4666666666666667, 's8': 0.4, 's2': 0.4, 's4': 0.3333333333333333, 's10': 0.13333333333333333, 'none': 0.06666666666666667})",0.8275041803460149,0.04885216792014701,2.0,1.0,1.0

Paper, $23.95.</p> <p>A woman in the Islamic northern Sudan lives what appears to be a beleaguered life. Before she is 10, a midwife circumcises her, snipping off her clitoris and stitching together the outer labia. In her late teens, she beautifies herself for marriage by removing all her body hair and scraping off the outer layer of her skin. Reliably virginal at marriage, she is soon abandoned by her husband for most of the year - he works in the city, she remains in the village with the children. Her marriage, in these circumstances, is fragile. Men divorce easily for other women, or take other wives, particularly if the first is barren. Throughout life a woman is legally under the control of her father, her brothers and her husband, and her behavior is tightly regulated.</p> <p>But there are spirits who possess at least some of the women and force them into rude, wanton behavior. Such spirits attack fertility and cause illness. To cure herself, a possessed woman must appease the spirit through ceremonies in which the spirit descends into her and states its demands: new sandals, new clothes, a husband's acquiescence in a wife's desires. These women are then members of the Zar cult.</p> <p>In ''Wombs and Alien Spirits: Women, Men and the Zar Cult in Northern Sudan,'' Janice Boddy - a professor of anthropology at the University of Toronto - has written a traditional ethnography, complete with kinship diagrams, Arabic terms, and many, many facts. By the end of the book you feel that you know her community of women well. The primary impact of post-modernism in anthropology - apart from some silliness - has been to sharpen and sensitize the ethnographer's eye. Ms. Boddy's language and authorial self-description betray the strong influence of post-modern theory. That influence leads her not to repudiate the business of writing ethnography, but to be highly aware of the multiple purposes and meanings that these women give to their activities. Such alertness lets her provide a better analytic explanation of spirit possession than most.</p> <p>Many anthropologists would interpret a cult such as the Zar as the means through which subordinate individuals express their needs in public. Ms. Boddy argues that the cult does more, that it is the major form of symbolic play for these adults. The spirits that possess them are prostitutes, doctors, military men, gypsies, cannibalistic sorcerers and women of holiness and purity - a range of northern Sudanese cultural characters. This vividly imagined other world, Ms. Boddy argues, is in itself esthetically and creatively rewarding. And through the variety of these self-representations, the cult enables its women to reflect upon their actual world, so that the spirit possession becomes almost a satiric commentary upon their experience of the feminine. Through imaginatively playing at being other, the author suggests, these women become more adept at imagining themselves.</p> <p>''Wombs and Alien Spirits'' is long and at times repetitive and overwritten. Yet much of it is fluent and vivid, and it left me intrigued.</p>",337774,WOMEN POSSESSED,9,2,325,Describe a cult by name and identify the cult members' activities in their everyday life.,Cult Lifestyles,../crowdsourcing_data/Pilot_2P-OrdPar-NoHigh//f1202122_anonymized,"Counter({'s17': 12, 's9': 11, 's15': 11, 's16': 10, 's3': 9, 's14': 6, 's18': 5, 's8': 3, 's10': 2, 's7': 2, 's5': 2, 's12': 2, 's2': 1, 's1': 1, 'none': 1, 's6': 1, 's11': 1})",80,17,15,0.506884686738714,"Counter({'s17': 0.7967207127586454, 's9': 0.7425767119511504, 's15': 0.7386237657695183, 's16': 0.7133903591588057, 's3': 0.6071523085227994, 's14': 0.39327116006265095, 's18': 0.3503547645887576, 's8': 0.20395798789987224, 's10': 0.1395525917507765, 's12': 0.1376048253345445, 's5': 0.12212120295162446, 's7': 0.12212120295162446, 's2': 0.0818367849482478, 'none': 0.08183634595607923, 's6': 0.07145740034555384, 's1': 0.05066380260607063, 's11': 0.05066380260607063})",0.5073883802086708,"Counter({'s17': 0.8, 's9': 0.7333333333333333, 's15': 0.7333333333333333, 's16': 0.6666666666666666, 's3': 0.6, 's14': 0.4, 's18': 0.3333333333333333, 's8': 0.2, 's10': 0.13333333333333333, 's5': 0.13333333333333333, 's12': 0.13333333333333333, 's7': 0.13333333333333333, 's2': 0.06666666666666667, 's1': 0.06666666666666667, 'none': 0.06666666666666667, 's6': 0.06666666666666667, 's11': 0.06666666666666667})",0.7967207127586454,0.08183634595607923,2.0,1.0,1.0

77.86666666666666,2,641,"<p>In 1984, Sibylle Schonemann and her husband, both film makers frustrated by restrictions on their work, asked the East German Government for exit visas. The next thing they knew, they had been arrested on charges that were never made clear to them. Ms. Schonemann spent a year as a political prisoner, then was put directly on a bus for the West. Her husband, who received a slightly longer sentence, and their two children were sent after her, with only a few suitcases of belongings.</p> <p>""Locked-Up Time,"" Ms. Schonemann's extraordinary documentary about that experience, begins with another bus on the highway, but this time the director is traveling in the opposite direction. In 1990, after the Berlin Wall had come down, she returned to the East. She says she wanted to confront the past, but the film is more remarkable for the way Ms. Schonemann confronts the individuals responsible for her arrest and imprisonment. This deft and chilling film has the style of a personal excursion into history and the urgency of a moment when history is still inchoate. ""Locked-Up Time"" will be shown at the New York Film Festival this afternoon at 4:30.</p> <p>Because it was shot in black and white, the documentary carries an aura of the past. This technique creates a strong, ironic tension. As Ms. Schonemann tracks down her prison warden, the man who interrogated her, the lawyer who failed her and the judge who convicted her, the film suggests that their experiences are far too fresh to be reacted to with anything like detachment or remorse. For them, the past is still the present.</p> <p>Ms. Schonemann eases into these interviews, beginning in the yard of a woman who lives near the prison. The director climbs to the top of a tree she saw from her cell window, while the neighbor says she had no idea political prisoners were being held there.</p> <p>The film maker moves on to the woman who was her jailer. Like most of those interviewed, this woman looks perfectly ordinary at first but comes to seem like a cog in an evil bureaucracy. She smiles and says she remembers Ms. Schonemann, as if they were old friends.</p> <p>But when Ms. Schonemann asks why a letter from her husband was withheld for six weeks, the warden pulls a book of rules off the shelf to show that she didn't break any.</p> <p>When Ms. Schonemann ambushes her interrogator as he is taking in his laundry, the man says: ""I don't really have grounds for reproaching myself. I acted, I believe, lawfully, I believed.""</p> <p>Ms. Schonemann's method in all her interviews is to be calm and restrained rather than confrontational. She seems to want understanding, if not an outright apology, from the people she questions That, it turns out, is asking too much too soon.</p> <p>There are scenes in which Ms. Schonemann returns to her cell, but she uses re-enactments very sparingly. A close-up of her hand as she takes off a ring is a loaded image of how dehumanized she felt in prison.</p> <p>Most often, she lets her questions fill in the details about what happened. Although this technique adds a bit of confusion that is intensified by the translation from German, it is an effective, nonpolemical approach that allows viewers to follow the film maker as she travels into the past.

67.93333333333334,2,690,"<p>Jurors in the trial of 11 Branch Davidians were told this week that some sect members, terrified and trapped in the flames that were destroying their compound, killed their children, killed one another and killed themselves.</p> <p>Still others, crammed in a concrete bunker under wet blankets and sleeping bags, suffocated as the fire turned their refuge into a kiln.</p> <p>Gruesome details of the final moments in the compound, presented as arson experts and a medical examiner outlined the results of their investigations, clearly left some jurors shaken.</p> <p>The testimony came in the fifth week of the trial of 11 members of the Branch Davidian sect on charges of murdering four agents of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms on Feb. 28 during a botched weapons raid on the cult's compound near Waco, Tex.  Six cult members were also killed, and a standoff with the authorities began that ended 51 days later when fire broke out as tanks operated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation pumped tear gas into the compound.</p> <p>The defendants are also accused of setting the April 19 fire that destroyed their compound. The bodies of the cult's leader, David Koresh, and 80 of his followers were found in the rubble.</p> <p>On Thursday, the medical examiner who investigated the deaths, Nizam Peerwani of Fort Worth, testified that Mr. Koresh, 33, died from a single gunshot wound to the center of the forehead. His chief lieutenant, Steve Schneider, died near him, from a gunshot wound in the mouth. Seventeen other sect members died of gunshots, including five children. At least one woman was shot in the back and a 2-year-old boy died of a single stab wound to the left side of his chest.</p> <p>Dr. Peerwani, who led teams performing autopsies, said 36 corpses, including those of all of the children found, were discovered inside a concrete bunker in the compound.</p> <p>Most of those in the concrete bunker died of smoke inhalation or suffocation, but several were killed when the bunker's roof collapsed, Dr. Peerwani said.</p> <p>Arson investigators used charts and videotapes to support prosecutors' assertions that the Branch Davidians themselves started the fire, but the defense quickly counterattacked.</p> <p>William Cass, a senior arson specialist with the Los Angeles Fire Department, testified that a four-member group led by an arson expert, Paul Gray of Houston, had determined that the fires started simultaneously in three sections of the compound.</p> <p>A videotape of the fire, taken by a Government plane, shows heat patterns erupting in the compound's southernmost corner on the second floor, then the chapel area, and finally the dining room. The corner fire started 90 seconds after the video shows an F.B.I. tank smashing into the area.</p> <p>Investigators say that in 10 minutes the fire grew into a fireball because of the wooden building's poor construction and because the debris from the tanks' battering fed the flames.</p> <p>But defense lawyers contend the fire started some time earlier, in the gymnasium, when the tanks knocked over gas lanterns that cult members had scattered throughout the compound.  Under cross-examination, Mr. Cass acknowledged that the prosecution's videotape showed a heat ""flash spot"" erupting near the gymnasium before the three heat spots the arson investigators had noted.</p> <p>Mr. Cass said the panel did not watch this section of the videotape because they searched for clues to the fire's ignition only in those areas where witnesses had reported seeing flames or smoke. Nor, he said, did the experts see F.B.I. logs in which observers note an earlier fire in the gymnasium. Mr. Gray did not show those logs to the other fire investigators, Mr. Cass said.</p> <p>""This is the first time I've ever seen them,"" he testified. Nonetheless, Mr. Cass told the jury, ""Nothing has changed my opinion that this is arson in three separate places.""</p> <p>Dr. James Quintiere, a fire prevention specialist from the University of Maryland, testified on Thursday that ""although there is some ambiguity in the literature,"" the CS gas used by the F.B.I. during the tank assault is ""almost impossible to ignite in its liquid form.""</p>",668635,Jury Told of Gruesome Final Moments in Cult Fire,12,0,325,Describe a cult by name and identify the cult members' activities in their everyday life.,Cult Lifestyles,../crowdsourcing_data/Pilot_2P-OrdPar-NoHigh//f1202122_anonymized,"Counter({'s1': 12, 's4': 12, 's3': 9, 's7': 9, 's5': 9, 's11': 9, 's8': 8, 's10': 8, 's15': 8, 's6': 8, 's14': 8, 's9': 7, 's2': 7, 's13': 7, 's16': 6, 's12': 6, 'none': 1})",134,17,15,0.5075745887067286,"Counter({'s1': 0.8243680741962899, 's4': 0.8149832468702334, 's5': 0.6677332614522017, 's3': 0.6472156739962031, 's7': 0.6472156739962031, 's11': 0.6472156739962031, 's6': 0.600046757668644, 's8': 0.5819478651739919, 's10': 0.5819478651739919, 's15': 0.5664671394082634, 's14': 0.5664671394082634, 's13': 0.5341092074620594, 's2': 0.5272769729929413, 's9': 0.5188314834126057, 's12': 0.45336067287411974, 's16': 0.4512092458132946, 'none': 0.07327566823959372})",0.4718476724042384,"Counter({'s1': 0.8, 's4': 0.8, 's3': 0.6, 's7': 0.6, 's5': 0.6, 's11': 0.6, 's8': 0.5333333333333333, 's10': 0.5333333333333333, 's15': 0.5333333333333333, 's6': 0.5333333333333333, 's14': 0.5333333333333333, 's9': 0.4666666666666667, 's2': 0.4666666666666667, 's13': 0.4666666666666667, 's16': 0.4, 's12': 0.4, 'none': 0.06666666666666667})",0.8243680741962899,0.07327566823959372,1.0,1.0,0.0

Rosenthal (column, April 12) is right that we should be working around  the globe to end the practice of female genital mutilation, but he is wrong that the courts should offer protection to Fauziya Kasinga.</p> <p>If our asylum protection is broadened to cover these cases, we will be issuing an invitation to all who can get to the United States and claim to be escaping female genital mutilation. Next we may be asked to protect those seeking protection against forced marriage or spousal abuse.</p> <p>What this might mean may be seen in the our response to China's one-child family planning policy. The issue is a government policy rather than a cultural  practice, but the result is instructive. As a result of our sympathetic standard for evaluating pleas by Chinese for protection against the intrusive family planning policy, smugglers coach their human cargo to claim asylum on that basis, and our asylum screening process becomes tied up in knots.</p> <p>What is most unjust in cases like these and in the Kasinga case is the prolonged detention.

It ended what the officials said was the biggest heroin trafficking investigation in New York history.</p> <p>Officials in the United States attorney general's office and the Drug Enforcement Administration said they had seized 257 pounds of heroin during a two-year joint investigation with Colombian law enforcement authorities into one of the city's top heroin suppliers.</p> <p>Michael J. Garcia, the United States attorney in Manhattan, called the international teamwork a ''new model for drug investigations.''</p> <p>''It's the only one I know of that has come together in this way,'' Mr. Garcia said at a news conference, adding that the drug operation had been effectively dismantled. ''Arrests were made along every single step of this chain.''</p> <p>While American officials regularly share intelligence with their foreign counterparts in the course of drug investigations, yesterday's arrests were called the first successful collaboration on such a large scale, the investigators said.</p> <p>The investigation into the ring began in 2004 with an anonymous tip to a heroin information telephone number set up by the Drug Enforcement Agency in Colombia. Yesterday, Colombian officials arrested nine people who the authorities say supplied two men in the Bronx who served as wholesalers. The two suspected wholesalers, Roberto Soto-Betran and Jaime Londono, were also arrested. A third person, Jose Rodriguez Nieves, who was already in custody, was accused of preparing the heroin in mills in the Bronx for retail distribution under different brand names, including Hypnotiq and Body Bag.</p> <p>Investigators said the operation had used various means to carry heroin from Colombia to New York City, including concealing it in the soles of flip-flops, in the lining of golf bags and inside antique dining room chairs. They said the ring also used the method of having human carriers swallow heroin-filled pellets.</p> <p>Most of the heroin on the East Coast comes from Colombia, according to the investigators, with much of it going through New York City before reaching other cities.</p>",1770877,30 Are Arrested in Breakup of Major Heroin Smuggling Ring,42,0,362,Identify incidents of human smuggling.,human smuggling,../crowdsourcing_data/Pilot_2P-OrdPar-NoHigh//f1202122_anonymized,"Counter({'none': 7, 's1': 6, 's7': 6, 's8': 4, 's6': 4, 's2': 3, 's5': 3, 's4': 3, 's3': 2})",38,9,15,0.3408713957278196,"Counter({'none': 0.48895747110891497, 's7': 0.4065246446516428, 's1': 0.3801800832183395, 's8': 0.2756621989788971, 's6': 0.2685516062545514, 's2': 0.19730909239436617, 's5': 0.19730909239436617, 's4': 0.19730909239436617, 's3': 0.13964035199975744})",0.3274987558201713,"Counter({'none': 0.4666666666666667, 's1': 0.4, 's7': 0.4, 's8': 0.26666666666666666, 's6': 0.26666666666666666, 's2': 0.2, 's5': 0.2, 's4': 0.2, 's3': 0.13333333333333333})",0.4065246446516428,0.48895747110891497,0.0,0.0,0.0

The Irish Vote Next</p> <p>Mr. Major met in Rio today with Prime Minister Albert Reynolds of Ireland, which will vote in a referendum on the treaty next Thursday. In the first national referendum on the treaty, held last week in Denmark, voters narrowly voted against it.</p> <p>All the major Irish political parties have asked voters to support the treaty, just as most of the major Danish political parties had. But if the Irish voters also reject it, most other Europeans agree, the Maastricht Treaty will be a dead letter. It cannot go into effect unless it is ratified by all 12 European Community members.</p> <p>Mr. Major suspended debate on ratification in Britain after the Danish surprise.</p> <p>Over the past week, his aides have suggested that one way to improve the chances of ratification everywhere would be to negotiate an additional protocol putting limits on the powers of the community bureaucracy in Brussels to legislate details of ordinary life.  Butterfat and Beer</p> <p>Some support for this idea has been reported in Germany as well. And in France, where President Francois Mitterrand said last week that he would submit the treaty to a referendum this year, the upper house of the legislature voted today to make it easier to challenge directives from Brussels.</p> <p>Directives from community headquarters telling French farmers that they have to pasteurize Camembert, British farmers that they leave too much butterfat in clotted cream and German brewers that they cannot keep chemical stabilizers out of beer have all revived doubts about the benefits of ever greater unity and standardization.</p> <p>Emotions about national sovereignty run high in Britain and in Denmark. Here, the concern centers around the fate of Germany's economic stability, of which the cornerstone, as Germans see it, is the mark.</p> <p>The warning published today by the German economists, including many well-known pro-Europeans, said that the goal of economic unity was a respectable one but that the Maastricht Treaty's provisions for establishing a common European currency by the end of the decade would not work.  Strong Words of Warning</p> <p>Trying too early to set up a common currency, the economists' statement said, could end up dividing Europe into economically weak and strong zones, rather than further uniting it, and could lead to higher inflation.</p> <p>""The hasty introduction of a European currency union will expose Western Europe to powerful economic tensions that could lead in the foreseeable future to a political confrontation, and thus endanger the goal of unity,"" the manifesto warned.</p> <p>One of the signers, Karl Schiller, a former Economics Minister, said in an interview: ""The debate in Germany on this has been very shallow up to now. I'm afraid that by pushing too soon for monetary union we would dig a ditch between the Western countries and others, like Finland, Poland and Czechoslovakia, who hope to become members of the European Community.""</p> <p>Germany's Parliament is expected to ratify the treaty, though it will take a two-thirds majority of both houses, including the one representing the states, where the governing Christian Democrats do not have a majority. If the states' interests are not adequately taken care of, said Florian Gerster, the European minister of the state of Rhineland-Palatinate, ""the consent of the states to the Maastricht Treaty remains uncertain.""</p> <p>Britain's House of Commons gave preliminary approval to the treaty last month, despite a score of defections from Conservative ranks, but the opposition Labor Party asked its members to abstain then. Now, according to Labor's deputy leader, Roy Hattersley, the party may oppose the treaty unless Mr. Major compromises with the other 11 members on coordinating labor policies.</p>",535460,Some Germans and Britons Grow Skittish Over Unity Treaty,67,2,378,"Identify documents that discuss opposition to the use of the euro, the European currency.",euro opposition,../crowdsourcing_data/Pilot_2P-OrdPar-NoHigh//f1202122_anonymized,"Counter({'s2': 12, 's3': 11, 's14': 11, 's15': 10, 's13': 9, 's1': 7, 's12': 6, 's17': 5, 's9': 4, 's8': 4, 's16': 4, 's5': 4, 's6': 4, 's11': 4, 's4': 4, 's10': 3, 's7': 3})",105,17,15,0.49221351986771933,"Counter({'s2': 0.8118833415466364, 's14': 0.760864878318673, 's15': 0.7127403553835857, 's3': 0.7082150832036201, 's13': 0.6377318565135977, 's1': 0.4740546563928021, 's12': 0.4231898962451246, 's17': 0.35364404062792937, 's11': 0.30603882035920393, 's16': 0.2824628245232718, 's5': 0.2680395719486964, 's9': 0.26149294061531353, 's8': 0.26149294061531353, 's6': 0.26149294061531353, 's4': 0.2605098201865765, 's10': 0.2089697238419247, 's7': 0.1929178364386298})",0.4831891994605613,"Counter({'s2': 0.8, 's3': 0.7333333333333333, 's14': 0.7333333333333333, 's15': 0.6666666666666666, 's13': 0.6, 's1': 0.4666666666666667, 's12': 0.4, 's17': 0.3333333333333333, 's9': 0.26666666666666666, 's8': 0.26666666666666666, 's16': 0.26666666666666666, 's5': 0.26666666666666666, 's6': 0.26666666666666666, 's11': 0.26666666666666666, 's4': 0.26666666666666666, 's10': 0.2, 's7': 0.2})",0.8118833415466364,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0

And President Jacques Chirac called new elections  in hopes of bringing ''new elan'' to the sterility of recent French political debate.</p> <p>Public opinion polls predict a narrow conservative victory in the two-stage vote for national legislature, on May 25 and June 1. But differences about monetary policy in the Gaullist camp emerged on Saturday from an election speech by Charles Pasqua, a conservative and former Interior Minister who stands to the right of Mr. Juppe on domestic issues.</p> <p>''There will be no new elan,'' Mr. Pasqua warned his followers, ''if France continues sacrificing full employment to currency.'' Mr. Pasqua made no effort to conceal his view that Mr. Juppe was not up to leading the campaign to victory.</p> <p>Mr. Juppe said tonight that he was not campaigning to succeed himself,  but it is widely expected that he would be reappointed to lead a new Conservative Government.</p> <p>The criteria for the common currency, including a strict limit on budget deficits, were set by the late President Francois Mitterrand, a Socialist, and other European leaders at a meeting in Maastricht, the Netherlands, at the end of 1991.</p> <p>But the leader of the Socialist opposition, Lionel Jospin, distanced his party from its former leader's position on the common currency in an interview published in today's Le Journal du Dimanche.</p> <p>''If fulfilling the Maastricht criteria requires imposing still another austerity cure, the country simply can't accept it, economically and socially,'' he said.</p> <p>In a campaign interview on French national television tonight, Mr. Juppe said, ''If the Maastricht criteria didn't exist, we'd have to do the same thing anyway. The French economy is asphyxiated by public expenses and taxes.''</p> <p>But he said that further austerity measures would not be required to shake France out of the doldrums of double-digit unemployment, now at 12.8 percent.</p> <p>''When growth returns, and everybody is predicting growth of 3 percent in 1998, that will permit us to reduce taxes and deficits,'' he said.</p> <p>A common currency, administered by an independent European central bank, would take many of these decisions out of national hands, the main reason why so many Conservatives in Britain oppose introducing the euro there.</p> <p>Mr. Mitterrand was among the principal architects of the treaty, and Mr. Jospin's Socialists campaigned for its acceptance in a hotly contested referendum in 1992.</p> <p>According to the public opinion polls, they do not stand to win a majority in the new 577-seat French legislature, but might be able to form a Government with the Communists if there were a leftward surge in the vote. Asked by his interviewers if he would consider governing with the Communists, Mr. Jospin said, ''Where's the problem?''</p> <p>Communist leaders have been fundamentally opposed to the European currency as an anti-inflationary sellout of the working class to the interests of global capitalism. On the far right, Jean-Marie Le Pen's National Front party is also against the euro, which he sees as an unacceptable surrender of French national sovereignty to European Union bureaucrats.</p> <p>So, Mr. Juppe argued, the only manageable electoral outcome was a conservative majority to pull Europe in the same direction as France's conservative President as the century ends. ''If the majority is returned, France will know where she is going,'' he said, campaigning on Saturday in Bordeaux, where he has been Mayor since 1995.</p>",926152,"On French Campaign Trail, Few Support New Currency",68,2,378,"Identify documents that discuss opposition to the use of the euro, the European currency.",euro opposition,../crowdsourcing_data/Pilot_2P-OrdPar-NoHigh//f1202122_anonymized,"Counter({'s1': 12, 's2': 10, 's7': 9, 's15': 9, 's12': 9, 's6': 6, 's4': 6, 's9': 3, 's8': 3, 's13': 3, 's16': 3, 's11': 3, 's14': 3, 's10': 2, 's5': 2, 's3': 2, 'none': 1})",86,17,15,0.45100075882925456,"Counter({'s1': 0.81399242396142, 's2': 0.7107495926292619, 's15': 0.6213428791217769, 's12': 0.6133633508223875, 's7': 0.6110631956497354, 's4': 0.4221568528734411, 's6': 0.41618779828346664, 's11': 0.21505262180794077, 's13': 0.2131559106164402, 's8': 0.19414414411317682, 's9': 0.18959979849038383, 's14': 0.18241805897925492, 's16': 0.16521927378881163, 's3': 0.15182972839614203, 's10': 0.12983352731051656, 's5': 0.12983352731051656, 'none': 0.06796463081846017})",0.4308070862849721,"Counter({'s1': 0.8, 's2': 0.6666666666666666, 's7': 0.6, 's15': 0.6, 's12': 0.6, 's6': 0.4, 's4': 0.4, 's9': 0.2, 's8': 0.2, 's13': 0.2, 's16': 0.2, 's11': 0.2, 's14': 0.2, 's10': 0.13333333333333333, 's5': 0.13333333333333333, 's3': 0.13333333333333333, 'none': 0.06666666666666667})",0.81399242396142,0.06796463081846017,2.0,1.0,1.0
131.33333333333334,2,809,"<p>Greece never had a prayer of joining the first round of countries eligible for Europe's common currency, so its exclusion from the list of 11 countries ready to adopt the euro in 1999 was not an issue here.</p> <p>Instead, the question is whether Greece, despite its belated efforts to trim its debts and shrink its overindulged state sector, is going to make it into the euro club in 2001 -- a goal firmly held by the Socialist Government of Prime Minister Costas Simitis and cherished by many Greeks.</p> <p>For Greece, joining the euro is much like the dream many members of the former Soviet bloc have of joining NATO or the European Union. The tangible benefits of being admitted into the charmed circle may be debatable, but being left out is hell.</p> <p>''It is already a negative thing to be out of the 11,'' said Dimitri Papadimoulis, spokesman for the Coalition of the Left, an opposition party. ''But if we stay out after 2001 the cost will be painful. Now we are the European country in the Balkans. Then we would be another Balkan country in the Balkans.''</p> <p>With the devaluation in March of the drachma by 14 percent -- the Greek currency is now part of a European exchange rate structure that is a prerequisite for future euro members -- the Simitis Government is convinced that Greece is on its way.</p> <p>According to Finance Minister Yiannos Papantoniou, Greece has accepted prodding from its European partners to do in 18 months what it had already promised to do in three years: tackle its bloated public sector with the privatization of 11 publicly held companies, including several state banks, by the end of 1999.</p> <p>''We have a mutual interest in succeeding,'' Mr. Papantoniou said, speaking of Greece's pledges to the other members of the European Union. ''At this point, I don't see major risks. We are on the right way.''</p> <p>But here and in the rest of Europe, there is some lingering skepticism about the ability of the Simitis Government -- heir to the left-wing political machine built by the late Andreas Papandreou -- to meet the harsh criteria set down for euro membership, and survive politically.</p> <p>As the poorest country in the European Union, with a per capita gross domestic product half that of Germany, an economy that is even more dependent on a corrupt and inefficient public sector than many ex-Communist countries, and a reputation for squandering European Union subsidies, Greece's chances of meeting the monetary union's criteria are far from guaranteed.</p> <p>''The next two years are going to be critical,'' said Costas Stambolis, editor of an economic newsletter. ''The Government will have to undertake wage freezes, a shrinking of the public sector, restructuring. It will create a lot of unrest, and they will have to cope with it.''</p> <p>The devaluation of the drachma, considered inevitable by many analysts, was presented, and for the most part received, as a bold and confident sign of the Government's commitment to Europe. The Athens stock market soared, while foreign investors were cheered by the Government's tough-talking pledges to move swiftly ahead with privatization and hold down public spending.</p> <p>But critics have since found reason to worry. Initially at least, the devaluation has put Greece, if anything, further away from the fiscal goals set for euro membership. In a country heavily dependent on imports, devaluation has led to a slight surge in inflation, and a slowing of the decrease in public debt, much of which is held in foreign currencies.</p> <p>Mostly, the doubts have to do with the Government's ability to follow through on its promises. ''Verbally they are doing extremely well,'' said Stefanos Manos, a former Finance Minister. ''But I am not convinced this Government will reach the euro criteria in time. The social base that elects this Government is in the public sector. Simitis will not cut off the branch he is sitting on.''</p> <p>The Simitis Government has scored notable successes in bringing its fiscal affairs in order. Inflation, which was in the double digits a few years ago, was down to 4.3 percent in February, while Greece's budget deficit, which was at an all-European high of 13.9 percent in 1993, had fallen to 4.2 percent in 1997, on its way to the 3 percent level set for entry into the euro.</p> <p>But many analysts see the final test of Greece's eligibility to join the euro -- to take place in the summer of 2000 -- as one that is as political as it is economic.</p> <p>''If we don't make it by 2001, we will never make it, and Greece will be pushed out of Europe,'' Mr. Manos said.

On Tuesday, Michael Howard, the Conservative leader, urged Britons to choose ''a better way'' because Mr. Blair's government had ''lost the plot.''</p> <p>May 5 had long been talked about as the most likely day for a contest that will be fought over issues ranging from the war in Iraq to the economy and public services, particularly education, police action against crime and the services offered by the National Health Service.</p> <p>''Our mission will be driven by values,'' Mr. Blair declared after visiting Buckingham Palace to seek Queen Elizabeth II's agreement to dissolve Parliament -- a ceremonial step opening what is sure to be a fierce campaign.</p> <p>A central argument for Mr. Blair is likely to be that Labor has managed the British economy well and still has work to do. ''This is the time to keep the progress going, move the country forward,'' he said in Dorset in southwest England in his first campaign appearance.</p> <p>Many political analysts in Britain have argued that Mr. Blair is virtually assured of victory because it would take an enormous swing toward the Conservatives to wipe out his commanding majority of around 160 seats in the 646-seat Parliament.</p> <p>But opinion surveys published in three newspapers on Tuesday showed Labor leading by only two to three percentage points, while a fourth poll based on the views of people who say they are certain of voting actually gave the Conservatives a 5-point lead.</p> <p>Since the British electoral system favors Labor's urban power base, even a margin of that magnitude would not translate into a Conservative majority at the polls. But if Mr. Blair's majority is seriously eroded, he could be viewed as a lame duck leader -- particularly because he has said he will not seek a fourth term. That, British political analysts maintain, would probably hasten his handing the torch to Gordon Brown, the chancellor of the exchequer and Mr. Blair's longstanding rival within the Labor Party.</p> <p>Another big challenge for Mr. Blair is to overcome voter apathy after two elections that gave him landslide majorities in the eight years since he first won power in 1997. To do that, he suggested Tuesday, he will embark on a personal campaign to try to restore the inspirational aura that surrounded his first few years as prime minister.</p> <p>He spoke of ''a belief that we should create a country where regardless of someone's class or background or race, or color or religion, they get the chance to make the most of themselves, to develop their potential to the full. And through them, the country gets its chance to develop its potential.''</p> <p>''So it's a big choice. It's a big decision,'' Mr. Blair said. ''The British people are the boss, and they are the ones that will make it.''</p> <p>Mr. Howard, the opposition leader, told his supporters that Mr. Blair was ''already secretly grinning about the prospect of his third victory.''</p> <p>''Well,'' he said, ''you don't have to settle for that.''</p>",1662787,Blair Calls Election for May 5 as His Party Slips in Polls,70,0,378,"Identify documents that discuss opposition to the use of the euro, the European currency.",euro opposition,../crowdsourcing_data/Pilot_2P-OrdPar-NoHigh//f1202122_anonymized,"Counter({'none': 10, 's3': 3, 's11': 3, 's1': 3, 's2': 2, 's10': 2, 's5': 2, 's6': 2, 's4': 2, 's9': 1, 's8': 1, 's7': 1, 's13': 1, 's12': 1, 's14': 1})",35,15,15,0.4908824727941023,"Counter({'none': 0.6969771000450258, 's1': 0.18911218606593763, 's11': 0.18241805897925492, 's3': 0.16521927378881163, 's2': 0.12983352731051656, 's5': 0.12983352731051656, 's6': 0.12983352731051656, 's4': 0.12983352731051656, 's10': 0.12109187675895675, 's9': 0.0685073450902184, 's8': 0.0685073450902184, 's7': 0.0685073450902184, 's13': 0.0685073450902184, 's12': 0.0685073450902184, 's14': 0.0685073450902184})",0.4567838181810956,"Counter({'none': 0.6666666666666666, 's3': 0.2, 's11': 0.2, 's1': 0.2, 's2': 0.13333333333333333, 's10': 0.13333333333333333, 's5': 0.13333333333333333, 's6': 0.13333333333333333, 's4': 0.13333333333333333, 's9': 0.06666666666666667, 's8': 0.06666666666666667, 's7': 0.06666666666666667, 's13': 0.06666666666666667, 's12': 0.06666666666666667, 's14': 0.06666666666666667})",0.18911218606593763,0.6969771000450258,0.0,0.0,0.0
156.6,2,819,"<p>In the days after a crippling strike by opponents of President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe, the government there has struck back with a wave of violence and intimidation that has brought condemnation from governments and human rights groups around the world.</p> <p>Human rights workers and diplomats say that with the world's attention focused on war in Iraq, Mr. Mugabe has unleashed Zimbabwe's armed forces and militia against his own people, even as the country prepares for two important parliamentary elections on Sunday.</p> <p>Internet reports from Harare describe hospital wards full of people suffering from severe burns and broken fingers and toes. Photographs show men and women with swollen lash marks across their backs and chests. Opposition leaders report that more than 1,000 people have fled their homes and that more than 500 people have been arrested.</p> <p>The police confirmed that they had arrested hundreds, adding that those detained had incited violence. Some of them, the police said, burned buses and cars. The police officials denied accusations of brutality.</p> <p>Human rights groups, however, say most of those arrested are leaders and supporters of Zimbabwe's main opposition party, the Movement for Democratic Change. The prisoners, human rights officials say, are often beaten and detained in their homes.</p> <p>The deepening tensions followed a two-day strike by the opposition that halted most business and industry in Zimbabwe. The action was considered the largest public protest against Mr. Mugabe, 79, since he was re-elected last year in a contest that was marred by charges of fraud and intimidation.</p> <p>Political analysts and opposition leaders issued forecasts for more political storms ahead. In a speech last Friday, Mr. Mugabe boasted that he could be a ''black Hitler, tenfold.''</p> <p>The State Department has called on the Zimbabwe government to ''cease its campaign of violent repression,'' and to bring to justice the perpetrators of ''serious and widespread human rights abuses.''</p> <p>South African leaders, long advocates of what they call ''quiet diplomacy'' with Zimbabwe, began on Wednesday to turn up the volume, with expressions of concern by President Thabo Mbeki of South Africa to Parliament. A South African diplomat in Harare said President Mbeki had ordered them to ''get to the bottom of the accusations and report back.''</p> <p>Amnesty International, in a report on Friday, issued a warning that said: ''The alarming escalation in political violence is a clear indication that the Zimbabwe authorities are determined to suppress dissent by any means necessary, regardless of the terrible consequences. We look upon the next 10 days with fear.''</p> <p>On Sunday, voters in two important townships currently controlled by the opposition are supposed to go to the polls to elect new representatives to the Zimbabwean Parliament.</p> <p>In a news conference today in Harare, opposition leaders showed reporters copies of the government's voter rolls, and said that dozens of people on the lists did not exist. Government officials dismissed those charges.</p> <p>Monday will mark the deadline set by the opposition for Mr. Mugabe to accept and begin addressing a list of 15 demands, including disbanding government militias, restoring freedom of the press and releasing all political prisoners.</p> <p>Mr. Mugabe, who has governed Zimbabwe since the end of white-minority rule more than 20 years ago, played down the impact of the strike and dismissed his opponents' demands, saying he would not obey ''pathetic puppets'' of the West.</p> <p>He also ordered security forces to crack down on those using violence against the government, accusing the opposition of employing mob aggression under the guise of defending human rights.</p> <p>The oppositon, emboldened by the success of its two-day strike, has promised ''mass action,'' against Mr. Mugabe. Morgan Tsvangirai, leader of the Movement for Democratic Change, said the violence by soldiers and militia had deepened the country's ''crisis of governance.''</p> <p>''No amount of brutality and arrests will discourage people from engaging in an agenda they have determined whose time has come,'' said Mr. Tsvangirai, who is currently on trial on charges of treason. ''The more the repression the more it will rebound.''</p> <p>In a full-page newspaper advertisement today, his party issued a call to the armed forces, urging them to serve the people, not the president.</p> <p>''To us in the M.D.C., the uniforms of the army should be a symbol of national pride, evoking a sense of security rather than terror,'' read the political ad. ''The M.D.C. says no to any attempt to pit the heavily armed security forces against defenseless people.''</p> <p>Perhaps the most devastating impact of Zimbabwe's political conflict has been on its economy, marked by an inflation rate now at more than 150 percent, with unemployment at 70 percent, severe shortages of gasoline and more than 60 percent of its population -- estimated at 11.6 million -- in need of food aid.</p>",1476053,Zimbabwe Opposition Reported to Be Targets of Violence,71,0,378,"Identify documents that discuss opposition to the use of the euro, the European currency.",euro opposition,../crowdsourcing_data/Pilot_2P-OrdPar-NoHigh//f1202122_anonymized,"Counter({'none': 11, 's9': 4, 's15': 4, 's19': 4, 's11': 4, 's4': 4, 's8': 3, 's2': 3, 's1': 3, 's17': 3, 's16': 3, 's20': 3, 's18': 3, 's12': 3, 's7': 3, 's14': 3, 's13': 2, 's10': 2, 's5': 2, 's6': 2, 's3': 2})",71,21,15,0.5851287067382946,"Counter({'none': 0.7511185515305258, 's9': 0.24888144846947424, 's15': 0.24888144846947424, 's19': 0.24888144846947424, 's11': 0.24888144846947424, 's4': 0.24888144846947424, 's8': 0.1988913636967166, 's2': 0.1988913636967166, 's1': 0.1988913636967166, 's17': 0.1988913636967166, 's18': 0.1988913636967166, 's12': 0.1988913636967166, 's16': 0.18576506670808804, 's7': 0.18576506670808804, 's20': 0.1836136396472629, 's14': 0.1836136396472629, 's13': 0.13362355487450528, 's10': 0.13362355487450528, 's5': 0.13362355487450528, 's6': 0.13362355487450528, 's3': 0.12049725788587672})",0.5650099350557115,"Counter({'none': 0.7333333333333333, 's9': 0.26666666666666666, 's15': 0.26666666666666666, 's19': 0.26666666666666666, 's11': 0.26666666666666666, 's4': 0.26666666666666666, 's8': 0.2, 's2': 0.2, 's1': 0.2, 's17': 0.2, 's16': 0.2, 's20': 0.2, 's18': 0.2, 's12': 0.2, 's7': 0.2, 's14': 0.2, 's13': 0.13333333333333333, 's10': 0.13333333333333333, 's5': 0.13333333333333333, 's6': 0.13333333333333333, 's3': 0.13333333333333333})",0.24888144846947424,0.7511185515305258,0.0,0.0,0.0
76.33333333333333,2,602,"<p>Less than six weeks before much of continental Europe adopts the new notes and coins of the euro single currency, Prime Minister Tony Blair is pressing his compatriots to jettison their traditional skepticism toward European integration and see it, instead, as an opportunity to extend their nation's influence.</p> <p>Mr. Blair is expected to deliver a speech in Birmingham on Friday that British newspapers have depicted as one of the most significant the prime minister will make -- what columnist Hugo Young in The Guardian newspaper called ''the most pro-Europe speech he has ever given to a domestic audience.''</p> <p>Moreover, Mr. Blair's spokesman said today, the prime minister would  use the example of the United States-led coalition against terrorism to argue that Britain can have a larger say in world affairs as part of an international alliance. That would, by extension, include the kind of cooperation necessary for European integration to succeed.</p> <p>Mr. Blair's spokesman, Alastair Campbell, gave advance details of the speech as part of an effort by the Blair government to soften British opposition to the euro in a country where opinion surveys show that more than two thirds of people still oppose the project.</p> <p>But Mr. Blair is expected to say  that the history of Britain's postwar relationship with continental Europe has been one of missed opportunities, caused by the timidity of politicians fearful of an anti-European backlash among their own voters.</p> <p>In effect, Mr. Blair is hoping that the impetus and lessons of his diplomacy as America's junior partner in the war in Afghanistan will carry over to his pro-European agenda.  But such are the sensitivities in Britain about the European Union that the speech will not mark the beginning of a headlong British rush into membership of the euro, Mr. Campbell said. And British officials were careful today to reject the idea that the speech will mark the beginning of a campaign by Mr. Blair to press for a referendum on the issue.</p> <p>''What he's not saying is that you join the single currency come what may,'' Mr. Campbell said. ''What he's saying is that we must take decisions in our own national interest and our interest is in being a strong player in Europe.''</p> <p>All but Britain, Sweden and Denmark among the European Union's 15 members subscribe to the single currency, which came into being in electronic transactions on Jan. 1, 1999, but which will become legal tender in most of Western Europe's stores, supermarkets, pocketbooks and pay packets on Jan. 1, 2002.</p> <p>Britain has declined to join since the single currency was first mooted almost a decade ago and the issue has become one of the most divisive. It has sparked a bitter feud between Mr. Blair and Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown, which Mr. Brown sought to play down in a published interview today, calling Mr. Blair ''the best friend I've had in politics.''</p> <p>Mr. Blair has promised to decide before the summer of 2003 whether to call a plebiscite on euro membership and, Mr. Campbell reiterated today, that decision will depend on whether participation in the single currency will benefit the British economy.</p> <p>In reality, most analysts see the decision as political, likely to be swayed by considerations of whether a referendum can be won. With the speech in Birmingham, Mr. Young, the columnist, said Mr. Blair would  carry the debate over the European Union onto ''the political ground where it essentially belongs.''</p>",1345311,Blair Set to Come Out Strongly for British Integration With Europe,72,0,378,"Identify documents that discuss opposition to the use of the euro, the European currency.",euro opposition,../crowdsourcing_data/Pilot_2P-OrdPar-NoHigh//f1202122_anonymized,"Counter({'s8': 11, 's1': 11, 's10': 11, 's9': 10, 's4': 10, 's7': 9, 's6': 9, 's2': 6, 's5': 6, 's3': 4, 's11': 4})",91,11,15,0.5894399436072741,"Counter({'s8': 0.7821316569670907, 's10': 0.7569505970318026, 's1': 0.7526128141180375, 's4': 0.7365823141573266, 's9': 0.7069605122590448, 's7': 0.6445138718820321, 's6': 0.6315451915347682, 's2': 0.3955671001094663, 's5': 0.3955671001094663, 's11': 0.2889521218621966, 's3': 0.26651316814149545})",0.548579837420025,"Counter({'s8': 0.7333333333333333, 's1': 0.7333333333333333, 's10': 0.7333333333333333, 's9': 0.6666666666666666, 's4': 0.6666666666666666, 's7': 0.6, 's6': 0.6, 's2': 0.4, 's5': 0.4, 's3': 0.26666666666666666, 's11': 0.26666666666666666})",0.7821316569670907,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0

Such illnesses result from repeating the same motions with arms and hands throughout the day, as occurs on assembly lines and at computer terminals. Carpal tunnel syndrome, for instance, causes pain in wrists and forearms, the Labor Department said.</p> <p>The Labor Department said there were 284,000 cases of occupational illness and 6.3 million job-related injuries among workers in private industry in 1989. Over all, that was 136,000 more than the 241,000 illnesses and 6.2 million injuries in 1988.</p> <p>Repetitive motion disorders rose from 115,000 in 1988 to 147,000. More Injuries and Illnesses</p> <p>In 1989 there was a rate of 8.6 injuries or illnesses per 100 full-time workers. Though the number of injuries or illnesses both increased by about 2 percent, the rate was unchanged from 1988 because employment and hours worked rose proportionately, the survey by the Bureau of Labor Statistics said.</p> <p>The Labor Department's sample survey estimated about 3,600 work-related deaths, but the agency said that its survey was not large enough to track fatalities accurately and that it thought its count had understated work-related deaths.</p> <p>The A.F.L.-C.I.O., which represents 14.2 million unionized workers, estimates that 10,000 American workers are killed on the job each year, while another 70,000 are permanently disabled.</p> <p>Gerard Scannell, the Assistant Labor Secretary who heads the Labor Department's Occupational Safety and Health Administration, said he was disappointed that there had been no improvement in the national rate of on-the-job injuries and illnesses.</p> <p>Injuries from accidents at work are reportable if they result in death, loss of consciousness, restricted work activity, a transfer to another job or medical treatment beyond first aid.</p> <p>Almost half the 6.3 million injury cases were serious enough for the injured worker to restrict work activity or lose work time. Those cases resulted in about 57 million lost workdays in 1989, the Labor Department said.</p> <p>About 20 percent of the employment in the private sector in 1989 was in manufacturing, but manufacturing accounted for slightly more than 33 percent of the total reported injuries. In contrast, the service industry had nearly 30 percent of the total workers but only 16 percent of the injury cases.</p> <p>Nine industries reported at least 100,000 injury cases each.

""We had to have a beginning, and once again San Francisco takes that lead.""  Requirements for Business</p> <p>The law, which applies to companies with 15 or more employees in San Francisco, requires that workers be provided with adjustable chairs, proper lighting and terminals with adjustable screens and detached keyboards.</p> <p>It also requires that workers without regularly scheduled rest breaks be given 15 minutes of alternative work, if available, after every two hours of work at a terminal.</p> <p>Mayor Agnos said Monday that he would sign the ordinance after business and labor leaders agreed to support amendments that would give businesses four years, instead of two, to comply fully with the law.</p> <p>Under the amendments, the two-year deadline for compliance now required by the law would be replaced with a three-stage process.</p> <p>Starting in a year any new equipment bought would have to comply with the ordinance. Businesses would have two and a half years to upgrade old equipment to comply with the law, but would not have to spend more than $250 per work station. Full compliance, regardless of cost, would have to be achieved four years after the ordinance takes effect.  Regulations' Cost</p> <p>Labor and business officials have estimated that the cost of compliance could run from as little as $200 per work station to several thousand dollars per work station.</p> <p>The ordinance is intended to prevent muscle and eye fatigue and wrist inflammations resulting from prolonged use of computer terminals.</p> <p>Similar attempts in other states and cities to regulate the use of computer terminals have been defeated by opposition in business. A law was enacted in Suffolk County, L.I., in 1988, but it was struck down by a state court, which ruled that such regulation was the province of state or Federal governments. The decision is under appeal.</p> <p>Mayor Agnos said today he was confident there would be no litigation to challenge San Francisco's law. But he also called for statewide regulations so San Francisco businesses would not be at a disadvantage.</p> <p>The California Division of Occupational Safety and Health has said it would propose regulation of the terminals.

67.53333333333333,2,449,"<p>WHAT: The Pro Flex personal wrist support made by the Ergodyne Corporation of St. Paul, Minn. Millions of supports, also known as wrist managers, have been sold. More than a million of the Pro Flex model alone have been sold since 1989, including half amillion this year. The company expects to sell a half million more in 1993. WHY: In 1990 the Bureau of Labor Statistics estimated that of the 46 million Americans using computer keyboards, more than 180,000 suffered from wrist or hand injuries linked to repetitive tasks like typing. The most serious repetitive stress injury, or R.S.I., is carpal tunnel syndrome, a swelling of nerves where they pass through the wrists. That can cause crippling pain, weakness, numbness or tingling in the hands or wrists. Less troubling injuries include a variety of inflammation and swelling problems.</p> <p>WHO NEEDS IT?: You, possibly. In this age of the ubiquitous computer keyboard, the average data-entry office worker will flex his wrists about 5,000 times a day. ""They have become occupational athletes,"" said Paula Newman, a spokeswoman for Ergodyne. WHO ELSE?: Actual athletes, like bowlers, bicyclists, tennis players, golfers and softball players, as well as workers involved in tasks like meat-cutting, operating a cash register, dealing cards or working on an assembly line. ""Basically, anyone who is involved with picking, packing or plucking,"" Ms. Newman said. HOW IT WORKS: Wraps around the wrist with Velcro-like fasteners (Ergodyne's name for hook and loop fasteners is Aplix) and across the palm between the thumb and index finger. The device is designed to keep the wrist straight without immobilizing it. Most older wrist supports contained hard plastic splints and sometimes laced up the forearm like a corset. The Pro Flex has flexible steel stays encased in two synthetic materials, Vinaguard and Ultrilure, that give it as much support as a hard wrist support but increased movement and comfort. WHERE TO BUY IT: See the ergonomic experts where you work. Most Pro Flex supports are sold to them in bulk by safety equipment distributors, but they are also available in some hardware stores and home centers under the Safety Maid label. Average cost: $20. FASHION FACTS: Sizes range from X-Small to X-Large, but there are only two color schemes: tan with navy or black with silver. There are no plans for pastel, fluorescent or leather models, although there have been requests. Ergodyne can customize its wrist supports with logos, company colors, reflective tape or employee numbers. THE REST OF THE LINE: Ergodyne sells matching back supports, foot rests, computer keyboard wrist rests, tennis elbow supports, hand exercisers and anti-vibration gloves (for jack-hammer operators).</p> <p>THING</p>",572210,Wrist Support,99,1,350,Is it hazardous to the health of individuals to work with computer terminals on a daily basis?,Health and Computer Terminals,../crowdsourcing_data/Pilot_2P-OrdPar-NoHigh//f1202122_anonymized,"Counter({'s2': 13, 's1': 13, 'none': 1})",27,3,15,0.856228010840425,"Counter({'s1': 0.9117583691448644, 's2': 0.9015587467720375, 'none': 0.03719119376207583})",0.790195835699782,"Counter({'s2': 0.8666666666666667, 's1': 0.8666666666666667, 'none': 0.06666666666666667})",0.9117583691448644,0.03719119376207583,1.0,1.0,1.0
50.666666666666664,2,764,"<p>WHEN the new Montefiore children's hospital opens in the Bronx next fall, it will have Internet computer terminals at each of its 105 beds to help educate, entertain and heal its young patients.</p> <p>The hospital, to be called the Children's Hospital at Montefiore, will be among the first to incorporate computers and limited Web access to such a degree in the care of its patients. Although no one is yet sure what tangible benefits will come out of it, the hospital's planners say they expect the computer network to be a pivotal resource for sick children and their families.</p> <p>Other hospitals, like Mount Sinai Hospital in New York and the University of Chicago's Children's Hospital, have used computer-based programs from organizations like the Starlight Children's Foundation and the Starbright Foundation to allow children to connect with other children through protected networks.</p> <p>So far, Montefiore's pediatrics service has done little with educational or entertainment technology. But the technology program at the new hospital will be more ambitious than efforts at other hospitals, said  Dr. Irwin Redlener, president of the Children's Hospital at Montefiore,  and it will involve more patients and their families.</p> <p>Jeb Weisman, senior director of information systems and technology for the Children's Hospital at Montefiore, said he viewed the program as a learning laboratory for health professionals, who can look for new ways to enhance the quality of life for the hospital's patients.</p> <p>''The first question we had to grapple with was 'What's going to be the point of this technology?' '' Mr. Weisman said. ''I think the jury's still out on whether you need a computer at every hospital bed.''</p> <p>But giving patients the power to inform themselves about their illnesses, Mr. Weisman said, will help them connect their experiences to the outside world. ''We have a way to engage the kids at a level that they live at every day,'' he said. ''Technology is a part of their life, and it's going to be part of their future lives and their working lives.''</p> <p>The hospital network will be accessible at bedsides through computer  terminals. Forty-two-inch flat-panel screens will be mounted on the walls, about 11 feet in front of each bed, to show both computer displays and television. In double rooms, the screens will be angled away from each other to ensure privacy. Speakers will be situated in special hospital pillows on the beds.</p> <p>The content on the network will include a range of games and activities for different age groups and an e-mail program to allow children to send messages to friends and teachers and, when other hospitals offer similar services, to other patients at those hospitals. But the primary focus of the network will be educational, Mr. Weisman said.</p> <p>''Our first interest is in helping patients learn about the reasons they're visiting,'' Mr. Weisman said. ''Whether they're in for asthma or diabetes, they'll be able to learn more about their condition.''</p> <p>The hospital is also planning a computer learning center, which a patient's family can use to get information about a patient's illness. Internet content will be filtered so children and families will be able to get access to reliable medical information that they can understand, as well as to educational sites like NASA's. Data will also come from medical CD-ROM's, which will be loaded onto the network. Information will be offered in different languages.</p> <p>Many factors specific to the needs of a children's hospital have been taken into consideration during the development of the network, Mr. Weisman said. The hospital planners initially considered mounting the computer screens on swing arms on the walls by the beds, for example, but they decided against that because they did not think that the swing arms would be easily movable in the event of an emergency.</p> <p>The network will be accessible via digital smart cards, which will allow patients to log on and pick up where they left off if they had to stop what they were doing to have a medical procedure done -- or even if they had left the hospital a few weeks or months earlier and then returned. The smart cards will make remembering passwords unnecessary.</p> <p>To help children who are unfamiliar with computers, the hospital plans to hire local high school students to help teach patients and their families. ''There's nothing more pitiful than an adult trying to be cool in front of a kid,'' Mr. Weisman said, ''so we're thinking older contemporaries will be more successful teachers.''</p>",1245753,Patients To Get Web At Bedside,100,0,350,Is it hazardous to the health of individuals to work with computer terminals on a daily basis?,Health and Computer Terminals,../crowdsourcing_data/Pilot_2P-OrdPar-NoHigh//f1202122_anonymized,"Counter({'none': 10, 's3': 5, 's2': 5, 's1': 5, 's6': 5, 's12': 5, 's14': 5, 's11': 5, 's9': 4, 's8': 4, 's10': 4, 's7': 4, 's5': 4, 's4': 4, 's13': 4})",73,15,15,0.5067620655144977,"Counter({'none': 0.6588755798318822, 's3': 0.34112442016811795, 's2': 0.34112442016811795, 's1': 0.34112442016811795, 's6': 0.34112442016811795, 's12': 0.34112442016811795, 's14': 0.34112442016811795, 's11': 0.34112442016811795, 's9': 0.29046061756204733, 's10': 0.29046061756204733, 's7': 0.29046061756204733, 's8': 0.27497699517912727, 's5': 0.27497699517912727, 's4': 0.27497699517912727, 's13': 0.27497699517912727})",0.512972403408964,"Counter({'none': 0.6666666666666666, 's3': 0.3333333333333333, 's2': 0.3333333333333333, 's1': 0.3333333333333333, 's6': 0.3333333333333333, 's12': 0.3333333333333333, 's14': 0.3333333333333333, 's11': 0.3333333333333333, 's9': 0.26666666666666666, 's8': 0.26666666666666666, 's10': 0.26666666666666666, 's7': 0.26666666666666666, 's5': 0.26666666666666666, 's4': 0.26666666666666666, 's13': 0.26666666666666666})",0.34112442016811795,0.6588755798318822,0.0,0.0,0.0

The challenge is not that personal computers might go away, or even decline in number, but that computing may no longer revolve so much around PC technology -- which Microsoft dominates with its industry-standard Windows operating system.</p> <p>Accordingly, Microsoft is trying to persuade outside developers to use its software tools instead of the tools of rivals like Sun Microsystems Inc.

At other times, however, it has strained way too far out, as when it contemplated creating a county navy. Now it has passed another bizarre bill, to regulate video display terminals, that would set a reckless precedent for other jurisdictions.</p> <p>On Long Island and nationally, Suffolk County's legislature has developed a reputation for being out front on, for instance, smoking and bottle return laws. At other times, however, it has strained way too far out, as when it contemplated creating a county navy. Now it has passed another bizarre bill, to regulate video display terminals, that would set a reckless precedent for other jurisdictions. When the county legislators passed such a measure last year, it was vetoed. The new bill deserves the same treatment from the County Executive, Patrick Halpin.</p> <p>In a decade, video display terminals have revolutionized much of American life, including the newspaper business and this newspaper. VDT's, with their television-style screens and typewriter-style keyboards, enable people to run mighty computers at work and publish volumes from home desktops. But there are fears of radiation dangers, or at least eye and back strain. It's natural for labor unions and others to be vigilant about hazards.</p> <p>Yet that vigilance hasn't uncovered any basis for fear, or for anything more than continued watchfulness and the ordinary prudence associated with any other office or home machine, say an electric typewriter. Certainly there's no need for the heavy hand of governmental regulation.</p> <p>Under the county bill, employers using 20 or more VDT's would be accountable to a new agency for obedience to a laundry list of rules microscopically governing even the design of the chairs used by people working at VDT's. The chairs must be five-legged; they must swivel; and they must be upholstered just so: ''Firmness of seat pans and backrests shall be at 20 millimeters.'' Employers would have to pay 80 percent of the cost of annual eye examinations and new glasses needed ''as a result of the operator's work on the terminals.''

This layer, part of an early effort to stabilize the 800-year-old tower, was originally placed around the tower in two phases, in the 19th century and again  in 1935, but was found only last fall by the 13-member committee that has been working on the tower for the last four years. Given the delicate nature of the operation, the cement mixture will only be removed in small pieces.</p> <p>The next phase of the project calls for the removal of lead counterweights that can now be seen on the outside of the tower and the installation of a huge  cement ring below ground around its foundation. Ten steel cables will link the northern side of the ring to firm layers of earth 160 feet below.</p> <p>The experts supervising the restoration believe these measures will allow it  to remain stable for at least another 50 years while pulling it back less than an inch from its current angle. This phase of the project should be completed by early in 1996, when the tower may be reopened to a limited number of tourists.</p> <p>Originally built as the belfry for Pisa's cathedral in 1173, the tower began  leaning in the 13th century as the ground below slowly gave way. It was closed to the public in 1990 after the 1989 collapse of a tower in Pavia raised new fears about its stability.

But they decided to continue through the night, flying over Libya into Egypt.</p> <p>Their landing site was west of Luxor, near a camel track, at 26.9 degrees north latitude, 28.2 degrees  east longitude.</p> <p>The balloon bounced twice before  settling to the ground just after 8 A.M. today (1 A.M. Eastern time).</p> <p>Dr. Piccard and Mr. Jones face a hero's welcome when they fly to Geneva from Cairo on Monday. The balloon was sponsored by a Swiss watch-making company, Breitling, and its captain, Dr. Piccard, is Swiss. The co-pilot, Mr. Jones, is British and the balloon was built in England.</p> <p>For the first time, Don Cameron, whose company in Bristol, England, Cameron Balloons, built the Breitling Orbiter 3, disclosed some of the technical innovations that helped bring the balloon to victory. In an  interview today, he said the experience gained from previous flights had led to success.</p> <p>Cameron Balloons has built many long-distance balloons, including those flown by various competitors in recent round-the-world attempts.</p> <p>All these balloons were Roziers -- hybrid balloons lifted by separate compartments containing helium and hot air, which is generated by propane burners. (Such balloons are named for their inventor, Jean Pilatre de Rozier, whose hydrogen-and-hot-air balloon exploded in 1785, making him the first person in history to die in an air accident.)</p> <p>Fully inflated, the Breitling Orbiter 3 stood 180 feet high -- about the height of the Leaning Tower of Pisa -- and contained a volume of gas and hot air equivalent to that of the water in seven Olympic-size swimming pools.</p> <p>''I would say that the most important improvement we built into the Breitling Orbiter 3,'' Mr. Cameron said, ''was a layer of foam insulation we installed around the helium-filled central section just a few millimeters thick. The foam filled the space between the gas-tight inner cell and the outer, aluminized plastic cover.</p> <p>''This helped to keep the helium from heating up, expanding, and leaking out during the day, and also kept the helium from cooling and contracting too much at night, forcing the pilots to heat air with their burners to maintain altitude. The net effect was to save propane fuel and extend the balloon's duration and range.''</p> <p>How effective was the new foam insulation?</p> <p>''The Breitling Orbiter 2, which lacked the foam layer, ran out of fuel after only 10 days and had to land far short of going around the world,'' Mr. Cameron said. ''The Breitling Orbiter 3 stayed up for 20 days and still had propane to spare.

He certainly showed that he is out of the ordinary when he defied the law and walked across a high wire strung between the towers of the World Trade Center in 1974. He displays his engineering side in ''To Reach the Clouds'' when he discusses the intricacies of covertly transporting his equipment to a tower roof and the all-night project of rigging the cable. He describes his first trip to the United States from Paris after reading about the trade center; recruiting accomplices; nighttime scouting trips through the towers; failed plans; suspicious security guards; his first triumphant steps; and the police and news media attention that bombarded him afterward. At times Petit's whimsy is too much, and his language melodramatic and self-conscious (''I offer to myself, for a throne, the highest tower ever built by man; for a ceremonial carpet, the most savagely gigantic city of the Americas; for my dominion, a tray of seas wetting my forehead; while the folds of my wind-sculpted cape surround me with majestically mortal whirls''). But he writes affectionately about the towers (he placed carpeting between the building and his rigging because ''I do not wish to leave even the tiniest scratch on the towers I love'').

This is not the case.</p> <p>The 1988-89 Cargill case involves the Trading With the Enemy Act and took place three years before enactment of the Cuban Democracy Act, which I sponsored and which became law on Oct. 23, 1992.</p> <p>The Cuban Democracy Act prohibited such trade. The results speak for themselves: United States trade through foreign subsidiaries fell from $718 million in 1991 to only $1.6 million last year. What remains covers contracts in effect when the Cuban Democracy Act became law because United States laws are not applied retroactively. The Cargill case discussed in the article involves the possible involvement by Cargill United States in the 1989 financing of sugar, which had already been sold by Cuba to Venezuela. The case is an enforcement action under the Trading With the Enemy Act, and it is continuing.</p> <p>I have expressed my outrage about this case to Attorney General Janet Reno and underscored that if the allegations are true and if Cargill is found guilty, both the corporate officers involved and the company should be prosecuted.</p> <p>Contrary, however, to your article's assertion that ""the trading involved here raises questions about the effectiveness of one of the most visible tools of United States foreign policy,"" the Cuban Democracy Act, passed four years after this case, definitely answers questions about the effectiveness of the embargo. United States trade through foreign subsidiaries has ground to a halt.</p> <p>While your article's investigative reporting is valuable, your analysis of the United States embargo must be put into context. The Cuban economy, particularly without its Soviet benefactor, is crumbling; Fidel Castro's own family wants out, and the final period of President Castro's dictatorship is here.</p> <p>The embargo has had its effect, and the day when the United States will trade with a free Cuba is near.</p> <p>In the meantime, it is important to correct the impression that is given by the article, that United States laws regarding trade with Cuba are lax.

But the documents made public today, in the form of a Cuban National Bank quarterly economic report, showed that imports from the Soviet Union in the first nine months of 1987 declined for the first time in nearly three decades.</p> <p>The papers were submitted by Cuban officials Jan. 18 at a meeting in Paris called by Cuba to try to reschedule its $2.4 billion debt to Western governments - chiefly Spain, France, Britain, West Germany and Japan.</p> <p>Soviet subsidies of Cuba, mainly through Moscow's supply of low-cost oil and its purchase of Cuban sugar at inflated prices, have been estimated at $4 billion to $5 billion a year. The Cuban National Bank document showed that imports from the Soviet Union in the first nine months of last year declined to $3.98 billion from $4.00 billion over the same period of 1986.</p> <p>The papers also provide a stark picture of a deteriorating Cuban economy. Last year was ''one of the worst years the country has had to face,'' said one document, showing that economic activity had contracted by 3.5 percent while investment decreased by more than 20 percent.</p> <p>Cuba owes an additional $3.1 billion to Western banks and suppliers, giving it one of the largest external debts per capita in the world, $2,000 per person, which is twice that owed by the average Brazilian.</p> <p>The disclosure that imports from the Soviet Union are in decline was seen by some experts as evidence of important changes in Cuban-Soviet relations.</p> <p>''It shows that the Soviets are starting to become conscious of the costs of subsidizing the Cuban economy,'' said Manuel Sanchez Perez, a former Cuban Deputy Minister of Material Technical Supply who defected in 1985. 'Can't Afford It Any More'</p> <p>A Reagan Administration expert, who asked not to be identified, made a similar point, saying: ''The Soviets can't afford it any more. They're looking for ways to try to force the Cubans to become more efficient.''</p> <p>Both Mr. Sanchez Perez and the Administration official suggested that Moscow may be signaling displeasure because the economic policies of Fidel Castro seem at variance with the ''perestroika,'' or economic restructuring, of Mikhail S. Gorbachev. Mr. Castro has adopted ''rectification,'' which involves going back to straight ideology and central planning.</p> <p>Moscow has taken other measures to reduce the economic burden that Cuba represents for the Soviet economy.</p> <p>Mr. Sanchez Perez disclosed that according to his sources Moscow had cut its subsidy for Cuban sugar. It now pays 36 cents a pound for sugar that is worth one-fourth that in the world market. But it had been paying 45 cents. The Soviet Union buys about 5.5 million tons of Cuban sugar annually.</p> <p>In addition, Soviet petroleum allocations have also been declining, Mr. Sanchez Perez reported.</p>",128021,Soviet Said to Reduce Support for Cuban Economy,159,2,414,How much sugar does Cuba export and which countries import it?,"Cuba, sugar, exports",../crowdsourcing_data/Pilot_2P-OrdPar-NoHigh//f1202122_anonymized,"Counter({'s14': 14, 's6': 10, 's3': 7, 's4': 5, 's9': 4, 's2': 4, 's1': 4, 's8': 3, 's7': 3, 's5': 3, 's10': 2, 's13': 2, 's15': 2, 's12': 2, 's11': 2})",67,15,15,0.5533343905178302,"Counter({'s14': 0.9662033142521689, 's6': 0.6911883421987203, 's3': 0.44642443260476283, 's4': 0.35405552739322904, 's2': 0.2824024390698321, 's1': 0.2824024390698321, 's9': 0.2682305178324187, 's8': 0.2035837602243427, 's7': 0.2035837602243427, 's5': 0.2035837602243427, 's10': 0.14501154076064, 's13': 0.12400311873419013, 's15': 0.12400311873419013, 's12': 0.12400311873419013, 's11': 0.12400311873419013})",0.5272523652037165,"Counter({'s14': 0.9333333333333333, 's6': 0.6666666666666666, 's3': 0.4666666666666667, 's4': 0.3333333333333333, 's9': 0.26666666666666666, 's2': 0.26666666666666666, 's1': 0.26666666666666666, 's8': 0.2, 's7': 0.2, 's5': 0.2, 's10': 0.13333333333333333, 's13': 0.13333333333333333, 's15': 0.13333333333333333, 's12': 0.13333333333333333, 's11': 0.13333333333333333})",0.9662033142521689,0.0,2.0,1.0,1.0

Of the 30 senators who received more than $15,000 each from the sugar industry, every one of them voted to extend sugar subsidies in 1990.</p> <p>Then add in the milk, tobacco and peanut subsidies, the savings and loan association bailout, self-interested utilities, the coal, chemical, oil and automobile industries, whose contributions lead to legislation that tilts prices and taxes in their favor.</p> <p>Who pays the bill? the very same consumers and taxpayers who are said to object to campaign finance reform.

How can they credibly argue that it would entrench incumbents when 95 percent of House incumbents get re-elected under the current rules?</p> <p>And isn't it both more effective and ethical to have each family pay an average of $5 every two years for fair elections, rather than to privatize our democracy and continue to allow General Motors and General Dynamics to pay for a pay-per-view Congress?

He was 92.</p> <p>He had been under treatment for pneumonia.</p> <p>When Mr. Bonzal arrived in Havana in February 1959 as Ambassador, relations between the United States and the revolutionary Castro Government had already begun to deteriorate. But stepping off the plane, Mr. Bonsal shook hands with a bearded Castro emissary and congratulated him on the bravery of the revolutionaries who had overthrown the dictatorship of Fulgencio Batista, which had been backed by Washington for many years.</p> <p>The act was widely noted in the Cuban press, and Prime Minister Fidel Castro, later the Cuban President, expressed appreciation for his ""friendly, cordial"" approach.</p> <p>Despite this auspicious beginning, Mr. Bonsal was unable to develop a dialogue with the revolutionary, and as nationalization of American-owned companies proceeded, his counsel of quiet negotiation was largely ignored in Washington.</p> <p>Without notifying him, the Eisenhower Administration suspended Cuba's sugar import quota -- three million tons -- in July 1960, in response to Havana's sale of a million tons of sugar to the Soviet Union. Mr. Bonsal opposed this and other economic sanctions against Mr. Castro as likely to drive him further into the Soviet orbit.</p> <p>He was recalled to Washington in October 1960 in retaliation for a Cuban demand that the United States Embassy staff in Havana be sharply reduced. He never returned. Six months later an American-trained force of Cuban exiles invaded Cuba at the Bay of Pigs and were ignominiously defeated.</p> <p>Mr. Bonsal summed up his experience in a 1971 book, ""Cuba, Castro and the United States,"" published by the University of Pittsburgh Press, in which he did not spare Mr. Castro harsh criticism. But he wrote, ""The Cuba of the future must be primarily the creation of Cubans living in Cuba.""</p> <p>Mr. Bonsal, fluent in Spanish, was no stranger to controversy. As Ambassador to Colombia from 1955 to 1957, he stirred the wrath of the dictator, Gen. Gustavo Rojas Pinilla, by consorting with opposition politicians and intellectuals.</p> <p>He had the satisfaction of returning shortly afterward to attend the inauguration of General Rojas Pinilla's successor after a coup. Later, as Ambassador to Bolivia, he sought out oil workers, miners and intellectuals, enabling him to establish good relations with the new Government of the National Revolutionary Movement and help steer it toward centrist politics.</p> <p>He later served as Ambassador to Morocco, and retired in 1965.</p> <p>Philip Wilson Bonsal was born May 22, 1903, in New York City, the son of Stephen and Henrietta Bonsal. As a journalist for The New York Herald, the father reported on the Spanish-American War, after which Spain ceded Cuba to the United States in 1898. Stephen Bonsal later became a diplomat.</p> <p>Philip attended schools in the Philippines and Switzerland, and earned a bachelor's degree at Yale. He worked in Latin America for the International Telephone and Telegraph Company, then joined the Federal Communications Commission as a telephone specialist and from there went to the State Department in 1937.

67.4,2,805,"<p>AS the only business columnist I know who was once a doorman, I couldn't read about the last-minute contract agreement for New York's apartment-building workers without thinking about the guillotine.</p> <p>It's not that my experience -- three summers at the portal of a classy old pile on 69th and Lexington -- turned me into a revolutionary. Quite the contrary, those summers gave me the wherewithal to grab a low spot on the totem pole of bourgeois life, a spot to which I have clung desperately ever since.</p> <p>No, I think of the guillotine because those summers and the years that followed taught me something about the changing nature of income inequality and class resentment. Back in 1978, when I made off with an Ivy League diploma, my first job paid less than I had been making opening doors and helping old ladies with their packages. Worse yet, it took me four years of full-time work before my white-collar wages exceeded what I would have earned in uniform back on East 69th Street. Even at that point, however, I was still in the hole. Think of all those semesters of forgone earnings. Think of the tuition, room, board and bookstore expenses. And think about the cost of all that capital.</p> <p>I have to acknowledge that in those days, I resented the wages of Teamsters and sanitation workers almost as much as I did hereditary wealth. Much has been written lately about the enormous earnings advantage conferred by a college education, but what's striking to me is that this advantage was once so scant. Thirty years ago, in fact, the economist Richard Freeman published a book called ''The Over-educated American,'' and although I was too young and stupid to realize it, I was one.</p> <p>It's true that I chose a line of work -- newspapers -- that is notorious for low entry-level wages, but the broader data bear me out. In 1978, men with a bachelor's degree had an estimated wage premium of just 21 percent over men who were high school graduates, according to ''The State of Working America 2004-2005'' by Lawrence Mishel, Jared Bernstein and Sylvia Allegretto.</p> <p>But in my case, even that modest premium was illusory. My new white-collar job required a car and crazy hours; there was little overtime pay. The progressive tax system probably further eroded the college premium, because higher earnings were subject to higher levies.</p> <p>In 2003, the most recent year for which the book contained data, the male college wage differential was 41.5 percent -- practically double what it was when I started out. Although it's possible that my current modest prosperity is entirely a result of good looks (that would account for why it's so modest), chances are that education played a big role in making me better off financially than the doormen among whom I once worked.</p> <p>In coming years, the earnings premium for educated Americans will probably increase because of factors like new technology, outsourcing, large numbers of unskilled immigrants and the tendency of the educated to marry one another. Within the economic arena, I doubt that much can be done about this differential.</p> <p>Today, it's doubtful that many college graduates would envy the pay and benefits of most blue-collar workers. Those who inherit money, meanwhile, can't be blamed for their own dumb luck. So most of us direct our class-based ire at what might be called the new earnings aristocracy. Consider Sanford I.

But George Bush's image-makers chose not to press the rhetorical point in his Presidential campaign, and for good reason.</p> <p>ARE you better or worse off than you were four years ago, asked Ronald Reagan in 1980. But George Bush's image-makers chose not to press the rhetorical point in his Presidential campaign, and for good reason.</p> <p>Young, male, blue-collar workers, part of the demographic coalition that has given Republicans a big leg up on the White House in recent decades, suffered devastating financial setbacks during the 1980's. While the real earnings of 25- to 34-year-old men who graduated college rose by 9 percent from 1979 to 1987, the earnings of high school dropouts fell 15 percent. High school graduates did not do much better, absorbing a 9 percent cut.</p> <p>Few economists are inclined to blame Republicans, or anyone else, for the way the chips fall in a free market: That would legitimize government tinkering with market-determined wages in order to right social wrongs. And the resulting efficiency losses would more than offset the social gains.</p> <p>If the rich have acquired too large a slice of the pie and the poor too small - the majority view, one would guess, among American economists - the smarter way to redistribute shares is to change taxes and government benefit programs.</p> <p>But it is still worth knowing how markets favor some and punish others, if only as a guide to figuring how much strain capitalism is putting on the social safety net. And probably no one has pushed the frontiers of knowledge on how blue-collar workers are faring further than the economists McKinley Blackburn of the University of South Carolina, David Bloom of Columbia University and Richard Freeman of Harvard University.</p> <p>Their most striking findings, detailed in the National Bureau of Economic Research Working Paper No. 3186 (November 1989), are negative.</p> <p>The real value of the Federal minimum wage fell by nearly one-fourth from 1980 to 1988. But, according to their study, the minimum affected so small a portion of the work force that it accounted for, at very most, 8 percent of the widening gap between high school dropouts and the college-educated.</p> <p>Many think technology has favored ''knowledge workers'' over those who work with their hands. That might be true, say the authors. But simulations suggest that the magnitude of the impact is too small to explain much of the change in wage patterns in the 1980's.</p> <p>Increased competition from women may have reduced men's wages. But this does not explain the growth in the blue/white earnings gap because the impact of the increased labor supply has been as great or greater on well-educated men.</p> <p>The declining quality of public education may have slowed productivity growth since the mid-1960's. But if it were responsible for a fall in the relative wages of blue-collar labor during the 1980's, one would expect to find that those who finished school at the beginning of the decade were doing better than those who finished near the end. And once again, the numbers are uncooperative. What, then, does explain the widening earnings gap? A lot of different things, the authors believe.</p> <p>The decline of unions, which typically raise blue-collar pay at the expense of white-collar workers, played a part. So did changes in the demand for labor, which channeled blue-collar workers into poorly paid service industries. So, too, did shifts in the relative supply of educated workers: A fall in the number of college graduates gave them an edge in salary negotiations.</p> <p>This last phenomenon looms largest when the last decade is contrasted with the previous one. Most factors eroding the financial position of the less educated were already at work in the mid-1970's. What changed so dramatically in the 1980's was the relative supply of labor: a flood of non-college workers forced down pay rates. The universally celebrated growth in total employment during the Reagan years, it seems, had a lot to do with the declining fortunes of workers at the bottom.</p> <p>This supply shift should be partly self-correcting in the 1990's: College enrollments are rising, even as the number of males reaching work age each year falls. But that alone, the authors believe, will not be nearly enough to put blue-collar workers back on an equitable earnings track.</p> <p>The economic question, then, and perhaps the political question as well, is whether Washington is prepared to give lower-income workers a break on taxes or government benefits needed to narrow the gap. The capital gains tax cut being pressed by Republicans is hardly designed to win their gratitude. But a rollback in the regressive Social Security payroll tax, proposed by Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Democrat of New York, and supported by some Congressional Democrats, just might.</p> <p>President Reagan's chickens may, at long last, be coming home to roost.</p>",317443,Economic Scene;   Blue-Collar Blues: Who Is to Blame?,188,1,690,Find documents which describe an advantage in hiring potential or increased income for graduates of U.S. colleges.,college education advantage,../crowdsourcing_data/Pilot_2P-OrdPar-NoHigh//f1202122_anonymized,"Counter({'s3': 13, 's8': 10, 's10': 10, 's11': 9, 's9': 8, 's6': 7, 's15': 7, 's13': 6, 's12': 6, 's14': 6, 's4': 5, 's5': 4, 's1': 4, 's16': 3, 's2': 2, 's7': 2, 'none': 1})",103,17,15,0.4684786541899619,"Counter({'s3': 0.8512630423201945, 's8': 0.6962788677326687, 's10': 0.6947075741577167, 's11': 0.6067549302784113, 's9': 0.5252144797084575, 's6': 0.498890643163342, 's15': 0.498890643163342, 's13': 0.4255018382473788, 's12': 0.4255018382473788, 's14': 0.4106890017924769, 's4': 0.3361943179525749, 's1': 0.2471581604780622, 's5': 0.24585320558858034, 's16': 0.16309196553390326, 's7': 0.12289636311561361, 's2': 0.10860326691359021, 'none': 0.0675810830389922})",0.4610160259586626,"Counter({'s3': 0.8666666666666667, 's8': 0.6666666666666666, 's10': 0.6666666666666666, 's11': 0.6, 's9': 0.5333333333333333, 's6': 0.4666666666666667, 's15': 0.4666666666666667, 's13': 0.4, 's12': 0.4, 's14': 0.4, 's4': 0.3333333333333333, 's5': 0.26666666666666666, 's1': 0.26666666666666666, 's16': 0.2, 's2': 0.13333333333333333, 's7': 0.13333333333333333, 'none': 0.06666666666666667})",0.8512630423201945,0.0675810830389922,1.0,1.0,1.0
61.8,2,666,"<p>For the better part of two decades, the catchy advertising jingle ''Be All That You Can Be,'' along with promises of on-the-job training and money for higher education, helped the United States Army meet its recruiting goals and gave the country a high-quality volunteer force. But now the Army, along with other branches of the armed services, is facing a serious recruiting gap that is forcing it to rethink its hiring practices and marketing strategy. The proposed changes in tactics outlined in an article in Monday's Times seem like a good start on what is likely to be a long and difficult effort to turn things around. As a collateral benefit, these changes may help society as well.</p> <p>Officials at the Pentagon offer several reasons for the declining lack of interest in military service. One is purely statistical. The pool of young men and women between the ages of 18 and 22, the optimum age for recruits, has shrunk to about 21 million, down 5 million from the 1980 level. Meanwhile, a robust economy has created abundant job opportunities for those who might otherwise be interested in enlisting, while making it financially feasible for more young people to attend college.</p> <p>There may also be more amorphous influences at work. Louis Caldera, the Secretary of the Army, notes that many of the parents of the present generation of recruits came of age after the draft ended in 1973, and thus have no tradition of military service to pass along to their offspring. Representative Steve Buyer, an Indiana Republican who heads the House subcommittee on military personnel, believes that the armed forces have never codified their basic mission since the end of the cold war and, under President Clinton, have begun to resemble an international fire brigade with poorly defined, helter-skelter responsibilities that might best be left to regional powers.</p> <p>Whatever the reason, the numbers are not good. When the fiscal year ends tomorrow, the Army will fall short of its goal for the second year in a row, signing up 7,000 fewer enlistees than the 74,500 it needs to maintain its force at current levels. The Air Force is expected to miss its target by a lesser amount and the Navy will just squeak by. Only the Marine Corps has kept pace. Like all the services, the Army has increased its advertising, raised its ''signing bonuses'' and increased its contribution to a recruit's post-military college tuition from $40,000 to $50,000. The Army has also sent young soldiers back into their neighborhoods to deliver pep talks to their civilian contemporaries.</p> <p>These tactics make sense, but the most promising strategy may lie, paradoxically, in the Pentagon's willingness to ease its standards. Under present rules, 90 percent of the Army's recruits must have at least a high school diploma. In recent years, however, the Army has found that recruits with lesser academic credentials like a general equivalency diploma -- G.E.D. for short -- have performed just as well as those with high school degrees. Thus, just as the Navy did last year, the Army is thinking of relaxing the 90 percent requirement, allowing more G.E.D. students into its ranks. It is also planning a pilot program that will pay 6,000 high school dropouts to pursue a G.E.D. so they can qualify to join the active force or the reserves. In a similar vein, the Army will try to sign up students who have started college but dropped out.</p> <p>In effect, the Army will increasingly be seeking its recruits among dropouts of one sort or another, as long as they possess or can be persuaded to obtain minimal credentials. This strategy could yield a double benefit. It could not only help the Army deal with its manpower problems but also give a new sense of direction to many thousands of young people who might otherwise wind up on the streets, unemployed or in dead-end service jobs.</p>",1141427,Shoring Up the Volunteer Army,189,0,690,Find documents which describe an advantage in hiring potential or increased income for graduates of U.S. colleges.,college education advantage,../crowdsourcing_data/Pilot_2P-OrdPar-NoHigh//f1202122_anonymized,"Counter({'none': 8, 's5': 7, 's3': 5, 's2': 5, 's1': 5, 's6': 5, 's4': 5})",40,7,15,0.4024152936404421,"Counter({'none': 0.5067293797799693, 's5': 0.4932706202200307, 's1': 0.3722777578561016, 's4': 0.3576710071804435, 's2': 0.35333606938414897, 's6': 0.3438915757215077, 's3': 0.3416330985783178})",0.4121663809242372,"Counter({'none': 0.5333333333333333, 's5': 0.4666666666666667, 's3': 0.3333333333333333, 's2': 0.3333333333333333, 's1': 0.3333333333333333, 's6': 0.3333333333333333, 's4': 0.3333333333333333})",0.4932706202200307,0.5067293797799693,0.0,0.0,0.0
90.06666666666666,2,557,"<p>President Clinton today proposed a $31 billion package of tax advantages and financial aid to make college more affordable for millions of families, including those earning as much as $120,000 annually.</p> <p>The centerpiece of the program, which requires Congressional approval, is a tax credit of $2,800 a year that would be phased in by 2003 to ease the cost for tuition and fees for eligible families.</p> <p>''When we open the doors to college, we open the doors to opportunity,'' Mr. Clinton said today at a gathering of college students in the Old Executive Office Building.</p> <p>The president's education budget would also include $35 million intended to encourage college dropouts to re-enroll; $40 million to help minority students embark on five-year, dual-degree programs; $716 million for Pell grants to aid needy students and $400 million for programs to keep students from low-income families in high school.</p> <p>Administration officials said the proposals would be intended for middle-class families but would also benefit families in higher income levels. Families making below $100,000 a year would receive the full benefits of the proposals, while those with incomes up to $120,000 would receive reduced benefits.</p> <p>The proposals would expand, but not replace, existing education tax credits and scholarships, which Congress enacted in 1997 at Mr. Clinton's request.</p> <p>The initiatives face an uncertain prospect in this election year, with Republicans in Congress hesitant to give Mr. Clinton any political advantage. A more ambitious tax cut package pushed by Senators Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, and Olympia J. Snowe, Republican of Maine, won bipartisan support last year but eventually died.</p> <p>''Some in Congress, I note, are saying that because this is an election year we really shouldn't try to do anything for the American people,'' Mr. Clinton said. ''Nothing, not a national election or a Washington snowstorm, should get in the way of making a college education more affordable for all Americans.''</p> <p>Mr. Clinton's announcement, like the health care measures he proposed on Wednesday, are part of a seasonal ritual in which the president tries to build interest in his State of the Union address, scheduled for next Thursday.</p> <p>Not all the details are announced early.

D'Amato in 1998.</p> <p>Mr. Clinton said the two had twisted his arm to include the education proposals in his 2001 budget.</p> <p>Introducing the president was Nina McLaughlin, a freshman at Trinity College in Washington, who said her family would significantly benefit from the proposals. Ms. McLaughlin has two younger brothers nearing college age. Her father is working overtime to pay for expenses, while her mother holds two jobs.</p> <p>Reminiscing about his own college days, Mr. Clinton said: ''I had the help of scholarships, loans and jobs.

Recently, Ms. Leonard advised a high school student with poor grades but a passion for automobiles, finding him an internship at an elite racing car company.</p> <p>She thought it could lead to a well-paid career. But the boy's parents were incensed, insisting that he go to college. Ms. Leonard suspects he will soon drop out and take less desirable work than the internship he rejected.</p> <p>This kind of thing is happening all over the country because of an illusion that college is for everyone and that a high-tech future requires as many college graduates as possible. Yet the Department of Labor expects only about a fourth of future jobs to require college degrees.</p> <p>Barbara Schneider and David Stevenson, authors of ''The Ambitious Generation: America's Teenagers, Motivated but Directionless'' (1999), say exaggerated beliefs about job needs can have dire results. Some 90 percent of seniors say they will go to college. Some 35 percent want to be engineers, architects, health professionals, social or natural scientists. But only 8 percent of openings will be in those fields.</p> <p>Many youths face this reality only after high school. Two-thirds of graduates enroll in college, but only half of these get bachelor's degrees by their late 20's. Another 15 percent finish community college. More than a third drop out with no degree, though some may return later.</p> <p>It is often said that without college a youth will be ''flipping hamburgers.'' But many good jobs -- computer and health technicians, equipment repair or finance personnel -- demand vocational or on-the-job training, not bachelor's degrees.</p> <p>Students who are unsuited for college but still attend may lose the chance for such jobs. In their cases, the flipping hamburgers myth could become reality.</p> <p>If all races and social classes have similar academic ability, then even in middle-class suburbs a goodly number of students should incline to technical careers.</p> <p>But parents won't hear of it.</p> <p>In some suburbs -- Montclair, N.J., is one -- counselors are pressured to get almost all students into college because if admission rates fall, children may switch to private schools. So youngsters are guided to universities even when they would benefit more from technical training.</p> <p>In less affluent communities too, uncritical college ambitions can impede counseling. Indeed, black adolescents plan on college at higher rates than whites. Glenda Rose, a high school adviser in Miami, says her efforts to help minority students get into technical schools are resisted by parents who believe a university education is now essential. Many students then drop out of college to take less rewarding jobs than those for which training programs prepare.</p> <p>Ms. Rose blames the media, church leaders and former President Bill Clinton (who urged universal college) for parents' misconceptions.</p> <p>Of course, job readiness is not the only reason for college, perhaps not the best reason. But today's push to prepare all students to attend does not mostly come from concern for their moral, cultural or intellectual growth. It stems from vocational myths.</p> <p>This will be tough to fix because aiming too low is worse than aiming too high. Counselors who urge some students to pursue nonacademic paths may confuse ability with race and class. The affluent have traditionally gone to college while minority and working-class children were tracked to training programs or workplaces, even when their talent justified college ambitions.</p> <p>But asking everyone to attend college does not serve all students well. Nor should universities have to devote resources to failing youngsters who don't belong.</p> <p>Somehow we've got to guide fewer students to college while also ensuring that higher education is more accessible to the disadvantaged.</p> <p>A first step should be adding counselors with improved training. Nationwide, there is now only one counselor for every 560 pupils, handling not only college and career advice but scheduling and discipline. Students cannot get good guidance with so little attention.</p> <p>Schools also need more business partners to set up internships and other school-to-work programs.

73.53333333333333,2,609,"<p>IN a time of intensified recruiting, soaring tuitions and unprecedented emphasis on higher education, you might assume that money for college is one of the military's biggest draws. Yet to the dismay of officials in charge of veterans' affairs, a third of veterans never take advantage of their education benefits -- although they have paid out money for the purpose of receiving them.</p> <p>That fact may surprise most Americans, but the free education benefits set aside for former soldiers are not entirely free. Unless you look very carefully through your enlistment papers and sign away future benefits, the government will take out $100 a month during the first year of service. Consider it a down payment for benefits to come.</p> <p>After three years of service, though, the benefits are worth a lot more than that initial investment. Veterans can get more than $36,000 for tuition, books, living expenses and most anything else that might come up, provided the money is used within 10 years.</p> <p>''We've still got work to do in understanding why people are paying into a program and then not availing themselves of its use,'' says Dennis B. Douglass, deputy director for education service at the Department of Veterans Affairs. ''Some of them are not only unaware that these benefits expire, but they are not even aware of the benefits available to them.''</p> <p>Today's participation rates are not exactly poor by historical standards. According to V.A. statistics, about half of eligible World War II veterans, or 7.8 million, took advantage of the education benefits under the first G.I. Bill of Rights. It was this bill that helped make higher education such an integral part of society.</p> <p>The enthusiasm of veterans of the Korean War era slipped a little, with about 4 in 10 using their education benefits. But even so, no less than 2.4 million of those veterans went to college on the government's dime.</p> <p>By the end of the Vietnam War, more veterans than ever were going to school under the G.I. Bill, about 8.2 million. But since the late 1970's only about two million have taken advantage of the benefits. Still, that's almost 7 in 10 veterans, a ratio that is only slightly lower than during the Vietnam era because of the overall decline in recent veterans.</p> <p>To stimulate more interest, the government has been pushing to remind soon-to-be veterans that money for college or training awaits them after discharge and that the benefits will expire. The size of the benefit has gone up, too, to about $1,000 a month for a full-time student. As recently as 2000, the stipend was $650 a month, so officials hope the increase will be enough to get more veterans to go to class. Benefits for reservists and National Guardsmen have been raised from $288 a month to as much as $800, depending on how long they have been on active duty.</p> <p>Beyond that, the benefits have expanded to include forms of education that the framers of the original G.I. Bill could not have envisioned. Veterans can now get larger lump sums for costly short-term training in technology-intensive fields like aerospace, computers and biotechnology. Benefits also pay for tests required for a professional license or certificate in fields as diverse as plumbing and medicine.</p> <p>''While the veteran of the 1940's was going to school to get ahead of the curve,'' Mr. Douglass says, ''the veteran of today is doing it because he's just trying to keep pace.''</p> <p>COLLEGE AND MONEY</p>",1642208,From Combat To Campus On the G.I.

50.333333333333336,2,567,"<p>New York's special education costs are growing at a bankrupting pace, and Gov. George Pataki is right to focus on containing them. But budget cuts cannot  cure a poorly designed system that not only encourages overspending with built-in conflicts of interest but also fails to comply with the law. Restructuring the system -- while avoiding Federal sanctions and costly lawsuits -- will require serious thought and careful coordination among school systems, local governments and the State Legislature.</p> <p>An obvious first step is to limit the influence of the special education lobby -- the nonprofit agencies that decide which children should enroll in special education classes and provide the special services those children receive.</p> <p>The special education program in New York State serves nearly 400,000 children, providing federally mandated instruction for students with physical, emotional or learning disabilities. The system has been sued for failing to provide instruction in a timely fashion as required by law and by longstanding consent decrees. It was recently sued again for maintaining special education preschoolers in segregated classes instead of mainstreaming them, as required by the Federal Individuals With Disabilities Education Act. The act requires grouping children with their nondisabled peers, and sending them out for periodic therapies.</p> <p>New York has two special education systems -- one for preschoolers, taught by private not-for-profit agencies, and one for kindergarten through 12th-grade students, operated by the school systems. The K-through-12 program costs the state $3.6 billion per year. Since 1980, the per pupil cost in the city has increased by 62 percent, as against only 7 percent for pupils in the general system.</p> <p>Preschool special education is less costly -- $700 million this year -- but is growing at four times the rate of the K-through-12 program. Part of this surge arises from changes in state and Federal law, which made special education for disabled 3- and 4-year-olds an entitlement. Other costs arise from the way New York does business.</p> <p>Most states have folded preschool special education into the public schools.  New York farms out its 3- and 4-year-olds to private agencies, which evaluate candidates for special education and sell the services those children receive. A report by the City Comptroller found that many preschool special education children get more services than their disabilities require, ""substantially increasing the cost of the program."" In addition, the report said, ""at least two-thirds of the children are enrolled in the same school that evaluated their  disability, a clear conflict of interest.""</p> <p>Further, the mainstreaming requirement in the disabilities act is routinely ignored. Although mainstreaming pupils with minor disabilities would be healthier and far less costly than the segregated approach, only 13.5 percent of New York's special education preschoolers are mainstreamed, as opposed to 57 percent for the country as a whole. The danger is that children who are classified disabled at age 3 will never escape the label or the special education program itself. The data provoked children's advocates to file yet another lawsuit.</p> <p>Public schools will eventually need to assume the tasks of screening and teaching preschool special education children. In a system that already has 100,000 fewer seats than students, that will mean building more schools. In the  meantime, the Legislature needs to take a leading role in restructuring the system. That means standing up to the special education lobby.</p>",859968,The Special Education Nightmare,217,1,379,Identify documents that discuss mainstreaming children with physical or mental impairments.,mainstreaming,../crowdsourcing_data/Pilot_2P-OrdPar-NoHigh//f1202122_anonymized,"Counter({'s3': 14, 's7': 12, 's8': 11, 's6': 10, 's5': 10, 's4': 10, 's1': 9, 's2': 8})",84,8,15,0.7234137221584281,"Counter({'s3': 0.9331738075024274, 's7': 0.8329760485873813, 's8': 0.774047123104737, 's6': 0.734328350679236, 's5': 0.734328350679236, 's4': 0.7226522339491172, 's1': 0.6473868221085289, 's2': 0.6014669102889774})",0.683100727204613,"Counter({'s3': 0.9333333333333333, 's7': 0.8, 's8': 0.7333333333333333, 's6': 0.6666666666666666, 's5': 0.6666666666666666, 's4': 0.6666666666666666, 's1': 0.6, 's2': 0.5333333333333333})",0.9331738075024274,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0

Children with and without disabilities are in class together and learning.</p> <p>In a fifth-grade classroom on a recent morning, 36 children sat on cushions and couches discussing geometry. It was hard to make out that eight children were either learning disabled or emotionally disturbed. Two teachers, including  one licensed in special education, taught the class together as a teacher's aide hovered.</p> <p>In another classroom, a second-grade teacher read aloud from an oversized book with a cluster of students in a corner, while another teacher patiently listened as a boy read on the floor. One girl skimmed alone through an advanced-level book with chapters.</p> <p>About 115 special-education students attend P.S. 321, out of 1,200 children in the school. In the three years since the inclusion program began, the number  of classes exclusively for special-education children there has shrunk from nine to six, as more children have returned to the regular classrooms. The program is being praised by independent evaluators, school officials say.</p> <p>P.S. 321 is one of four schools in the city with the voluntary inclusion program. Three dozen preschool classes across the city have a similar program, which has resulted in a sharp decline in referrals to restricted special-education classes, said Stephen K. Allinger, the lobbyist for the school board in Albany.</p> <p>Beth Lief, the executive director of the New York City Fund for Public Education, a private advocacy group, estimated that about half the schoolchildren now enrolled in the city's exclusively special-education classes  could benefit from such programs.</p> <p>The new program costs slightly more money than if there were two separate programs, because P.S. 321 wants to keep the student-to-teacher ratios as low as possible, officials say.</p> <p>'It's not a snap of the fingers,"" Ms. Lief said.

As a founding director, Mr. McBride helped develop a curriculum to educate artists in new imaging and multimedia technologies.</p> <p>After Kodak sold the center in 1993 to Brace Management, which subsequently folded it, Mr. McBride left to found United Digital Artists, a new-media agency in Manhattan that represents high-technology artists, as well as software programmers and technology consultants.</p> <p>The company's clients, who specialize in creating on-line services and interactive products like CD-ROM titles, multimedia games and interactive movies, have worked for big technology and media companies, including Apple Computer, CNN, Disney, Random House and Time Warner.</p> <p>Question. How does your company differ from traditional talent agencies?</p> <p>Answer. We broker creative talent, but we differ from the traditional publishing and entertainment models. We educate artists and clients about both the potential and limitations of new technology. And we put together the best imaginable teams of artists and programmers.</p> <p>Q. Sounds like you are creating a virtual corporation.</p> <p>A. The lifeblood of the industry is the independent artists and multimedia developers who still answer their own phones, don't get much sleep and are brilliant. They're the new-media garage bands.</p> <p>Q. When do you think interactivity will hit the popular culture?</p> <p>A. We're seeing a few best-selling interactive games and storybooks like ""Myst,"" ""Doom,"" ""Grandma and Me."" The numbers are still not close to what you get with a paperback best seller or box office hit. I like to think that will happen soon.</p> <p>Q. What aspect of the digital revolution is being overlooked?</p> <p>A. We need to remember that it's artists who create. Computers are just tools -- no more, no less inspired than Rembrandt's paintbrush.</p> <p>Q. What coming technologies are you waiting for?</p> <p>A. Many new media tools are still awfully clunky and awkward to use. I look forward to the day when digital tools are transparent and artists can collaborate on line.</p> <p>Q. What advice would you give a company getting involved in interactive products?</p> <p>A. There's no substitute for vision, talent and content.

Unfortunately, this is not true of the organizations of disabled people, or the voluntary and charitable organizations serving them. Reduced government programs and charitable giving have seriously threatened many fine organizations serving the disabled, and a shortage of housing and medical services has created a critical situation for the disabled themselves.</p> <p>Fully 10 percent of our population is handicapped to a degree that hinders their ability to function. Their problems have a heavy impact on their families and the social-welfare agencies of our city, public and private.</p> <p>Those who would aspire to be mayor of New York City must consider these issues:</p> <p>* Despite efforts by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority and others to make mass transit more accessible to the disabled, the vast majority of the disabled find it extremely difficult to hold jobs or to get around because of transportation problems. The paratransit system has never really got off the ground in any meaningful way, and there are few alternatives.</p> <p>* Affordable housing for the disabled is not available, despite a new law requiring all new construction to be handicapped-accessible. The law adds the costs to construction, which are passed on in higher rents to the disabled, as well as others. This well-meaning law needs revision. In the meantime, disabled adults live with aging parents, in nursing homes or in the nonhousing offered the homeless.</p> <p>* The special-education program of the Board of Education generally lags far behind such programs in other cities. Few new facilities have been built, and handicapped students often languish in deteriorating buildings and overcrowded classrooms under the myth of ''mainstreaming.''</p> <p>* Recent changes in immigration laws make it possible to import an alien to shovel manure at Belmont Park, but not to bring in an alien to assist a handicapped person with essentials of daily living!</p> <p>* Loneliness and isolation are the great enemies of the disabled in our large city. Fewer than 10 percent of churches and synagogues are accessible, or welcoming, to the disabled and their families. Parks and recreation centers are hardly safe havens. Only under ''supervised'' circumstances will the disabled venture into the cultural life around them.</p> <p>No person deserves to lead New York City who will ignore the needs of this deserving segment of our population.

Previously this population had little, if any, vocational options other than sheltered workshops. Mr. McCarthy, while attesting to the benefits of supportive employment, raised many unresolved issues; eligibility, responsibility for implementation of job trainers and the acquisition of social skills that are necessary in order for mentally handicapped people to be successful in their employment situations.</p> <p>The Education for All Handicapped Children Act, Public Law 94-142, guarantees every handicapped child ''a free and appropriate education.'' What is a more appropriate education for a moderately mentally handicapped student than to learn those social and vocational skills necessary to enable him/her meaningful employment while living within the community?</p> <p>The student's school district should be the responsible party in facilitating this concept through the youngster's Individual Educational Plan. There should be no predetermined age at which this training starts. Districts should not be allowed to only begin this process when a student reaches late teens. (How is this individualized?) Presently, some districts have created segregated, simulated work environments. Very often students are relegated to these prevocational classes for up to five years before any real job situations occur. Students in these programs have no opportunity for the necessary acquisition of social skills because there is no contact with the mainstream population.</p> <p>As the parent of one such handicapped child, I have sought to enlighten my district as to my daughter's needs and its obligation. (Unfortunately this has to be accomplished through a long administrative hearing that will ultimately lead to Federal court.) My district's version of an appropriate IEP for my 15-year-old daughter contains no mainstreaming and no vocational training, in spite of the fact that she was successfully employed at the local Y.M.C.A. for the entire summer! This supportive employment was planned and implemented by a privately hired psychologist, job trainer, the enthusiastic staff of the Y and myself. The very institution (the public school) that should have provided this vital service played no role in this success story.</p> <p>Mr. McCarthy asked parents to help professionals in finding the answers to his questions. We have some. We know our handicapped children's capabilities, we have come to accept their limitations. What we cannot accept, however, is an antiquated system that prevents handicapped children from those services to which they are entitled!</p> <p>MARILEE SHANNON</p> <p>West Bay Shore</p>",331728,Synopsis of the Plight Of the Handicapped,222,0,379,Identify documents that discuss mainstreaming children with physical or mental impairments.,mainstreaming,../crowdsourcing_data/Pilot_2P-OrdPar-NoHigh//f1202122_anonymized,"Counter({'s5': 13, 's4': 13, 's6': 12, 's7': 11, 's3': 8, 's2': 7, 's1': 7, 's9': 2, 's8': 1, 'none': 1})",75,10,15,0.6753008131368557,"Counter({'s4': 0.9099977043059636, 's5': 0.8995945712284061, 's6': 0.8475255365785104, 's7': 0.7747832386299607, 's3': 0.5752788709473574, 's2': 0.5011948188722917, 's1': 0.487522635361649, 's9': 0.12550840680902978, 's8': 0.07343937215913396, 'none': 0.03793326104414055})",0.6178152176296168,"Counter({'s5': 0.8666666666666667, 's4': 0.8666666666666667, 's6': 0.8, 's7': 0.7333333333333333, 's3': 0.5333333333333333, 's2': 0.4666666666666667, 's1': 0.4666666666666667, 's9': 0.13333333333333333, 's8': 0.06666666666666667, 'none': 0.06666666666666667})",0.9099977043059636,0.03793326104414055,1.0,1.0,0.0

He said the proposal had been made to Mr. Eliasson, who this week ended 16 days of shuttle diplomacy and left for New York after four visits each to Teheran and Baghdad.</p> <p>There was no word, however, of a response from Baghdad to the new Iranian terms, and thus no guarantee that the hostile neighbors would be able to unlock the stalemate since the August 1988 cease-fire stilled eight years of war that claimed a million lives.</p> <p>The Iranian and Iraqi statements were the first sign of movement in Mr. Eliasson's mediation effort.</p> <p>Foreign Minister Velayati told Mr. Eliasson that Iran's shift was ''a move in good will and a bid to help break the present artificial impasse, which benefits no one,'' the Iranian agency said.

He is expected to report on the outcome of his effort this week. Optimism Voiced at U.N.  Some at the United Nations were optimistic that a cease-fire would be achieved soon. The Italian Foreign Minister, Giulio Andreotti, who presided over the Security Council in October, said Saturday, ''in my opinion we could manage to have something conclusive within a few days.''</p> <p>Although the formal responses delivered at United Nation headquarters late last week have not yet been made public, Mr. Rafsanjani's comments seemed to indicate that Iran is far from ready to accept the Security Council's call for an immediate cease-fire. The United States and Britain have said they will seek an arms embargo against Iran if it rejects the call for an immediate cease-fire contained in Security Council Resolution 598, which was adopted July 20.</p> <p>Mr. Rafsanjani accused the United Nations of ''procrastination, issuing a complex resolution, raising an untimely cease-fire and following unjust views,'' according to a Teheran radio broadcast monitored by Reuters.</p> <p>Mr. Rafsanjani said, ''We have put forth solutions in our dialogue with the Security Council, but as time passes it seems that those involved in world problems are largely untrustable and given to deception.'' Soviet Official's Mission</p> <p>The radio broadcast came only a few hours after the Soviet envoy, Yuli M. Vorontsov, ended a mission that also included stops in Iraq and Kuwait.</p> <p>The official Iranian press agency offered no details today of the visit of Mr. Vorontsov, a Soviet First Deputy Foreign Minister.</p> <p>Mr. Rafsanjani again emphasized Iran's longstanding demand that Iraq be branded as the aggressor in the war before a cease-fire can take place.</p> <p>Mr. Rafsanjani said, ''They say a cease-fire must be declared first to bring about calm, then a committee will be set up to identify the aggressor.

199.66666666666666,2,444,"<p>Iran, increasingly isolated even by former allies, was formally rebuked by the International Atomic Energy Agency on Friday in a resolution that sharply criticized it for a lack of cooperation in disclosing the details of its nuclear program.</p> <p>The resolution, sponsored by Britain, France and Germany and fine-tuned in the last few days, accuses Iran of not leveling about where it obtained blueprints and parts for advanced centrifuges, which can produce weapons-grade uranium. It passed unanimously after the country's usual defenders, including Russia and China, distanced themselves from Iran.</p> <p>The resolution also criticizes Iran for not explaining how several sites in the country were contaminated with highly enriched uranium. And it contends that the country hampered the efforts of inspectors to explore the suspect facilities.</p> <p>The episode is the latest in a nearly two-year confrontation in which the agency's frustrations with Iraq are beginning to show. The director of the agency, Mohamed ElBaradei, said the statement ''calls in very explicit terms on Iran to accelerate its cooperation.'' He said it must clear up the lingering questions within ''the next few months.''</p> <p>Iran defiantly rejected the pressure. A senior Iranian diplomat, Amir Zamaninia, warned that Tehran would instead reconsider ''voluntary confidence-building measures,'' which include a pledge to suspend the enrichment of uranium, a preliminary step in producing a nuclear device.</p> <p>Iran's chief delegate here, Hossein Mousavian, was more conciliatory, saying his government would continue to work with the agency and would abide by its existing agreements.</p> <p>The United States welcomed the resolution, but left little doubt that it would have preferred a stiffer response. The American ambassador to the agency, Kenneth C. Brill, asked the board to consider whether more urgent steps were needed to compel Iran to cooperate.</p> <p>''The passage of time is not a neutral factor in proliferation cases,'' Mr. Brill said in a statement.</p> <p>The United States lobbied unsuccessfully for the resolution to include a deadline for Iran to show a more compliant attitude. Mr. Brill said Washington still believed that the matter should be referred to the United Nations Security Council, where Iran could face sanctions.</p> <p>The next step in the showdown could come soon, as the agency looks into reports that Iran may have conducted nuclear activity on an undeclared site next to a military facility near Tehran. Commercial satellite images indicate that Iran razed buildings and removed topsoil from the area.</p> <p>With environmental sampling, officials close to the agency said, it would not be hard to determine whether nuclear activity had occurred there.</p>",1590458,Iran Rebuked by U.N.

69.53333333333333,2,427,"<p>FOR four years after playing host to the 1992 Earth Summit here, Brazil claimed that the destruction of the Amazon rain forest -- home to the world's richest trove of bacterial, plant, animal and insect species -- was on the decline.</p> <p>But when it finally released data last year on the period through 1994, the figures showed precisely the opposite, a 34 percent increase in deforestation, to about 15,000 square kilometers a year from 11,000 square kilometers, destroyed through colonization by ranchers and farmers and illegal logging.</p> <p>Once again this year, official word on the extent of rain forest destruction, this time for data since 1994, is running late, with the Government pledging to release them the day before the Kyoto conference begins. But the thick clouds of black smoke that have shut schools and airports near the forests' edges have left little doubt among Brazilians about the trend.</p> <p>Weather satellites show the number of fires increased 11 percent in the June to October burning season. While most fires are not located in primary rain forest, some environmentalists believe that the increased burning corresponds to an increase in deforestation and makes the rain forests more vulnerable to accidental fires.</p> <p>Brazilian officials say they are making progress. They are moving to crack down on deforestation by revoking 63 percent of logging licenses, many of which were being used to log in excess of legal limits, and are overhauling government policies that traditionally rewarded ranching or planting in the rain forest as an improvement on the land.</p> <p>But environmentalists fear that the Amazon may face new threats ahead. A state-of-the-art radar surveillance project to reveal the Amazon's hidden resources is under way, as well as major road projects to make the Amazon more accessible for industry.</p> <p>Before the Kyoto meeting, Brazilian officials said their country's fires and rain forest destruction paled next to the environmental damage caused by United States industry, which puts out 22 percent of the world's fossil fuel emissions. Brazil says it puts out less than 3 percent of the fossil fuel emissions.</p> <p>Brazilian officials also criticize the G-7, the seven richest industrial nations, for declining to spend $1.5 billion for environmental protection programs that Brazil requested in 1990.

Under the main agreement, approved at the 1992 Earth Summit here, Brazil was to provide just 10 percent of the $250 million.</p> <p>The pilot program, which pays for surveying the vast rain forest, has been the principal vehicle for marking off 40,000 square miles for Indian reservations.</p> <p>Surveying is seen as the first step toward protecting the Amazon from destruction by ranchers, loggers, farmers and miners.</p> <p>The Group of Seven money was also earmarked for promoting sustainable development, controlling deforestation and other objectives.</p> <p>In addition, the money would have helped pay for setting aside 10 percent of the rain forest, or 240,000 square miles, as national parks and ecologically protected areas. Amid much fanfare, Brazil's President, Fernando Henrique Cardoso, pledged to establish the protected areas on a visit to New York last April.</p> <p>Covering an area half as big as the continental United States, the Amazon is a lush laboratory of plants, animals and bacteria that contains more than 20 percent of the world's fresh water supply. Throughout much of the decade, as other countries criticized Brazil for failing to protect the rain forest, the Government insisted that wealthy nations pay to map it and to protect its resources. Officials also contended that the scale of the program was insufficient to the task.</p> <p>But environmentalists say that even that modest effort is now in jeopardy. Under pressure to rein in the budget deficit, Brazilian Government officials have slashed spending across the board. A recent agreement with the International Monetary Fund, which is heading a $41.3 billion standby loan for Brazil, reduces Government spending on environmental programs by two-thirds.</p> <p>Under the pilot program, the Brazilian Government provides matching funds and manpower to administer the Group of Seven grant. The Government's revised budget, made public in November, cuts the amount Brazil can expect to get from the group to $6.4 million from more than $61 million.</p> <p>''It is arguably a far more irrational and perverse consequence of the I.M.F. agreement than even the harshest critics of the I.M.F. could have imagined,'' said Stephan Schwartzman, a senior scientist at the Washington-based Environmental Defense Fund.</p> <p>Acre in western Brazil, one of the nine states covered by the rain forest, had developed a three-year program counting on some $5 million of the Group of Seven money to survey and zone its forest.

Environmentalists and development proponents, often at odds, would cheer. Thanks to the Frank Weeden Foundation of Connecticut, there's no need to imagine. It has provided a way to buy, in effect, bonds for biology.</p> <p>In July, Conservation International, a nonprofit U.S. environmental group, used a $100,000 Weeden grant to buy discounted Bolivian debt certificates. Then it swapped these to the Bolivian Government in exchange for its agreement to expand the Beni Biosphere Reserve. The reserve, in Bolivia's Amazon basin, is home to 13 species of endangered plants and animals, more than 500 different varieties of birds and more species of trees than all North America.</p> <p>In August, Costa Rica launched a more systematic program, run through its Ministry of Natural Resources. Potential donors are now being solicited to buy $5.4 million of outstanding debt, to be recycled through the Central Bank for local currency bonds. Revenues will go for land acquisition, park management and reforestation. For Costa Rica, reforestation also makes possible future export earnings from harvests of precious woods.</p> <p>The third world's low credit rating these days actually works to multiply the value of an environmentally linked donation. Bankers' jitters about possible debt moratoriums and defaults have driven debt prices well below face value. U.S. dollars used to buy up debt certificates thus yield far more than their normal equivalent in local funds. In the case of Costa Rica, a donation of $250,000 would pay for environmental bonds worth $500,000.</p> <p>Swaps like these can meet only a fraction of outstanding third world debt. Costa Rica's program aims to convert a little more than 10 percent of its total debt burden, Bolivia's about 15 percent. But the bonds do give interested donors a way to help conquer two urgent third world problems.</p> <p>Governments and multinational institutions could play an even greater role. Senators Alfonse D'Amato of New York and Robert Kasten of Wisconsin, and Representatives John Porter of Illinois and David Obey of Wisconsin, are sponsoring legislation that would direct the U.S. representative at the World Bank to propose an environmentally linked debt relief program through the bank.

40.8,2,397,"<p>Brazil's President, Fernando Henrique Cardoso, now has on his desk new legislation that finally gives the country's environmental agency a modicum of power to enforce environmental laws. A coalition of ranchers and industrialists managed to strip the bill of some of its toughest provisions, and is trying to persuade Mr. Cardoso to veto the  important measures that remain. Before doing so, he should think carefully about a report issued last week by the Brazilian National Space Research Institute, which found that deforestation in Brazil's Amazon is growing alarmingly.</p> <p>Brazil has good laws on the books protecting the Amazon but no legal power to enforce them. The environmental agency can levy only absurdly small fines and collects less than 10 percent of them. The legislation passed last week to correct this has been sitting in Congress for seven years.</p> <p>At the top of the list of measures Mr. Cardoso should preserve is a requirement that companies pay the cost of cleaning up environmental damage they caused, even if the Government cannot prove the damage was intentional. Mr. Cardoso should also save a provision that prohibits proven polluters from getting Government contracts or bidding on Government loans for several years, and another measure setting daily fines for companies that refuse to clean up their damage.</p> <p>Enforcement of environmental laws is particularly crucial given the evidence that damage to the Amazon is rapidly worsening. This contributes to global warming and destroys a forest that houses the most diverse group of plants and animals in the world. The new report, which uses satellite data, found that clear-cutting has been rising at a rapid rate. The 1995-96 burning season saw 7,000 square miles destroyed, almost double the annual deforestation that took place four years earlier.</p> <p>The Amazon suffers from other damage not extensive enough to show up in satellite pictures, such as selective logging, fires and drying. A recent report by Brazil's Congress found that the total area affected annually is more than 22,000 square miles.  Another study, by the Woods Hole Research Institute in Massachusetts, found that cutting and burning have dried out the forest to the point that it could burn out of control. Brazil's deforestation is likely to rise as Asian logging companies move deeper into the Amazon.

The most viable solution, not yet presented, is economical and does not require dubious governmental intervention.</p> <p>The settlers are burning the Amazon forest because they need profits from farming and cattle raising on the cleared land. Those profits, unfortunately, are only temporary because of the nature of the fragile Amazon soil. The only alternative for these settlers is the development of the rain forest itself, i.e., the lumber industry.</p> <p>Selective tree cutting has never been and never will be a danger for the hardwood forest. For example, large hardwood European forests, where selective logging has been practiced more than two centuries, has resulted in larger oak forests today than 300 years ago. It should be noted that the rain forest cannot be reforested by planting, as practiced in the softwood forests worldwide.</p> <p>Why should selective cutting be implemented? The Amazonian forest contains 20 to 60 trees an acre, but only one or two can be used for industrial purposes. Only these trees can be felled economically because exploration requires heavy, expensive, high-oil-consumption equipment. This machinery can be amortized only by cutting large high-yield trees. The main advantage of selective cutting is that the younger trees get more access to light and water, accelerating the natural growth cycle of the forest.</p> <p>Lumber companies, together with settlers working for the industry, will preserve their source of supply through selective cutting, thus earning the most money per acre.</p> <p>The settlers will then become interested in forest preservation, that is, in not burning their source of supply and their working tools. Additional commercial resources, such as nuts, fruits, medicinal plants and other natural products, can be found in the forest in the course of penetrating for selective cutting.</p> <p>Americans, through misinformation, might reject Brazilian imported lumber and lumber products, thereby involuntarily forcing the settlers to continue their disastrous burning. Acceptance of Amazonian forest products and the resulting economic impact on the producers is the only viable solution.

What stands in the way of so compelling a solution?</p> <p>Brazil owes the world $115 billion. The world wants Brazil to stop recklessly destroying the Amazon rain forest, an extraordinary natural wonder. Those two conditions invite a deal, a grand debt-for-nature swap that would ease Brazil's burden of foreign borrowing and preserve the Amazon forests. What stands in the way of so compelling a solution? Brazil's President, Jose Sarney, for one thing. Last month his Foreign Minister, Roberto de Abreu Sodre, received an American delegation that included Thomas Lovejoy, a tropical biologist, and Senators Tim Wirth, Albert Gore and John Heinz. Mr. Sodre enthusiastically endorsed the idea of a Brazilian foundation to administer a debt-for-nature swap. But when the group reached the presidential palace, Mr. Sarney rejected the idea as foreign interference. ''We don't want the Amazon to become a green Persian Gulf,'' he said.</p> <p>Mr. Sarney's notion of foreigners taking possession of the Amazon is a groundless fear concocted by his military advisers. His nonchalance toward the state of the forests does not accord with his own Government's data. Amazonia is fast being torched by landless settlers. The province of Rondonia, which holds one of the world's richest ecosystems, is already 17 percent deforested.</p> <p>The destruction is a bitter waste because the forest soil is for the most part too poor for farming. The settlers raise a few years' crops and then move on. Even cattle ranches are uneconomic and survive only through Government subsidies.</p> <p>Loss of the forests destroys both their Amerindian inhabitants and the livelihood of the rubber-tree tappers, who exploit the forest without destroying it. Last December the leader of the rubber tappers' union, Francisco Mendes Filho, was murdered after he campaigned to protect the rain forest from settlers' bulldozers. Despite death threats, the Government failed to protect him.</p> <p>How can Brazil's forests and their rich dowry of rare plants and animals be saved? The means are at hand in Brazil's debt. Suppose donors in the West could raise $4 billion to save the Amazonian rain forests. They would then buy discounted Brazilian debt with a face value of, say, $8 billion. That debt, denominated in dollars, is exchanged in Brazil for bonds worth $8 billion in local currency. The bonds are then donated to endow a Brazilian environmental institute charged with protecting the rain forest.</p> <p>Everyone would benefit because (a) the institute gets generous income from the interest and principal paid on the debt; (b) the Brazilian Government gets to pay off its debt in local currency instead of in scarce foreign exchange; (c) Brazil can then afford more imports from the donor countries; (d) creditor banks are relieved of dubious loans, and (e) an irreplaceable rain forest is saved for future generations.</p> <p>It's as much in the West's interest to help Brazil save Amazonia as it is in Brazil's. The forests are ancient nurseries of life where evolution has progressed for eons, uninterrupted by the ice ages that have periodically wiped out most species in temperate latitudes. The extensive burning of Amazonia adds greatly to the burden of carbon dioxide, cause of the feared greenhouse warming of the earth's atmosphere. Because aid can be so highly leveraged through debt exchange, the forests are cheap to save.</p> <p>As for Brazil, it would lighten its foreign debt burden by helping to save its own natural heritage. The clearer view of Brazilian interests comes from Mr. Sarney's Foreign Minister, not his generals.</p>",220124,Brazil's Debt Can Save the Amazon,282,0,400,What measures are being taken by local South American authorities to preserve the Amazon tropical rain forest?,Amazon rain forest,../crowdsourcing_data/Pilot_2P-OrdPar-NoHigh//f1202122_anonymized,"Counter({'s2': 12, 's8': 11, 's6': 11, 's9': 9, 's1': 9, 's7': 9, 's3': 8, 's5': 7, 's4': 4})",80,9,15,0.6076122279641799,"Counter({'s2': 0.8092698355403828, 's6': 0.7834450537148582, 's8': 0.7796652801163021, 's7': 0.6228588180909116, 's9': 0.6170361665783173, 's1': 0.6065577547092843, 's3': 0.5701923178617884, 's5': 0.49159681716068226, 's4': 0.3154653431789054})",0.5804027494055783,"Counter({'s2': 0.8, 's8': 0.7333333333333333, 's6': 0.7333333333333333, 's9': 0.6, 's1': 0.6, 's7': 0.6, 's3': 0.5333333333333333, 's5': 0.4666666666666667, 's4': 0.26666666666666666})",0.8092698355403828,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0

New quotas, to be adopted in Brussels on Thursday, are likely to reduce Britain's share of the catch by allowing 40 Spanish vessels in rich fishing grounds in the Irish Sea.</p> <p>The outcome of the vote, 299 to 297, was humiliating for the Government. Enough Tory dissenters on Europe and representatives of coastal fishing areas joined the opposition to hand it a defeat. During the debate critics accused the Government of not defending the rights of Britain's fishermen vigorously enough.</p> <p>The outcome was largely symbolic since the language of the motion made clear  that it was expressing Parliament's opinion and not mandating a change in policy -- roughly the equivalent of an American Congressional resolution. So the Government will not fall or have to submit itself to a vote of confidence.</p> <p>Nonetheless it showed how tenuous is Mr. Major's hold over his own party, which is trailing the opposition Labor Party by some 30 points in public opinion polls. In Parliament, the Conservative majority has shrunk to five and that could be reduced further by two off-year elections scheduled before the next general election, which must be held by the spring of 1997.</p> <p>Mr. Major's stature among the party's right-wing ""Euro-skeptics,"" who oppose  allowing more power to slip away to Brussels as provided by the Treaty on European Unity, had already been damaged by events on Friday at the European Union summit meeting in Madrid. Leaders of the 15-country group resolved to press ahead with plans for a single currency beginning in January 1999, and to call it the euro.</p> <p>The Prime Minister sought to apply the brakes to the single currency, arguing in Madrid that such a momentous step should not be taken precipitously and that  the economies of many member nations were not yet ready.

In 1959 we fled Fidel Castro's Cuba for the United States, where we started from scratch. It was a modest start with profits guaranteed by no one, and risk, as with all farming, abundant. Today we're proud to employ more than 3,000 Floridians making an average of $31,000 a year.</p> <p>The ''subsidy'' myth: There is no subsidy. United States sugar policy prevents the dumping of foreign sugar, just as its trade policy prevents the dumping of foreign-subsidized cars. In addition, the General Accounting Office report that cites a hidden consumer cost has been discredited by the Department of Agriculture. Sugar is cheaper in the United States than in most other countries.</p> <p>Another myth is that sugar farmers are not cooperating with Everglades restoration efforts. Three years ago sugar farmers joined with the Federal Government on a plan to restore the Everglades.</p> <p>Even as the plan was showing good results, a state ballot issue was proposed, with a multibillion-dollar price tag. The scheme, which included additional sugar taxes, was rejected by Florida voters for good reasons: they wanted further evidence that the proposal was sound, and they thought that it unfairly singled out sugar farmers.</p> <p>Finally, there is the myth that there is a villain and an easy solution. It was the Army Corps of Engineers, acting with the best intentions, that helped divert the natural flow of water in the Everglades. It acted rashly. As a result, today five million people live on and impact what was once the Everglades.</p> <p>Fixing the Everglades is complex, and much restoration is under way. We should give it a chance while looking for better ways to proceed.

118.53333333333333,1,544,"<p>During the last 20 years, the incomes of college graduates have risen while workers with only high school educations have seen earnings and job opportunities evaporate. New York State, with its vast numbers of poor, cannot afford to worsen the trend. Given that imperative, one of the signal issues in Albany this spring is the dispute over funding for public colleges and universities -- the schools of choice for low-income New Yorkers seeking to better their lot.</p> <p>The 21-campus City University of New York and the 64-campus State University  of New York certainly need restructuring -- and perhaps even some campus closings -- to meet new fiscal realities. But cuts in student aid proposed by Gov. George Pataki have frightened even fiscal conservatives, many of whom see the cuts as too much, too fast -- and an unfair blow to the poor.</p> <p>CUNY and SUNY have experienced a steady series of cuts in state funding -- often with dramatic consequences. The two systems were forced to impose tuition  increases of $750 last year -- from $2,650 to $3,400 at SUNY and from $2,450 to  $3,200 at CUNY. The higher fees drove out many struggling students, and were partly responsible for a combined enrollment drop of 16,000 in the two systems.</p> <p>Now Mr. Pataki is proposing dramatic cuts and formula changes in the Tuition  Assistance Program, known as TAP, that would make it even harder for low-income  students to attend college. In New York City alone, TAP cuts would cause 50,000  students to lose up to $1,029 each per year -- with the heaviest hit on families earning under $16,000.</p> <p>The SUNY board of trustees, now controlled by Mr. Pataki, has not protested the cuts. But an internal SUNY analysis shows justifiable worry on the front lines. At SUNY Binghamton, for example, 65 percent of the TAP recipients would lose an average of $934 each -- a ruinous sum for poor and lower-middle-class students. At some community colleges, low-income students would lose roughly 60  percent of their state aid. The administration also proposes letting aid increases lag a year behind tuition increases, further pressing poor families.</p> <p>The Pataki administration says the cuts are warranted because New York is overly generous, spending three times as much on tuition assistance as Pennsylvania, Illinois or California. It estimates that, even after the cuts, nearly a third of New York's 300,000 TAP recipients will receive full-tuition scholarships. But tuition is less than half the cost of an actual SUNY or CUNY education.</p> <p>State Education Commissioner Richard P. Mills was on the mark when he argued  against the cuts, saying that the TAP was an investment in New York's future --  and in a more highly skilled work force. That investment is already falling short of what is needed. Despite substantial enrollment increases over the last  decade, higher education aid has grown more slowly in New York than in almost any other state. Before shifting costs onto the shoulders of struggling families, Mr. Pataki needs to look hard for economies elsewhere. The Legislature needs to resolve the TAP debate quickly. Uncertainty over student aid could prompt many New Yorkers not to apply to college at all.</p>",835331,Keep College Open to the Poor,182,1,690,Find documents which describe an advantage in hiring potential or increased income for graduates of U.S. colleges.,college education advantage,../crowdsourcing_data/Pilot_2P-OrdPar-NoHigh//f1202110_anonymized,"Counter({'s1': 13, 's2': 6, 's7': 6, 's3': 5, 's6': 5, 's5': 5, 's4': 4, 'none': 1})",45,8,15,0.48457218940181396,"Counter({'s1': 0.85733491898956, 's2': 0.38649470125379953, 's7': 0.38649470125379953, 's6': 0.31940226329849336, 's3': 0.31872973242999636, 's5': 0.31872973242999636, 's4': 0.2806176876125981, 'none': 0.07645289979889637})",0.4894481174774463,"Counter({'s1': 0.8666666666666667, 's2': 0.4, 's7': 0.4, 's3': 0.3333333333333333, 's6': 0.3333333333333333, 's5': 0.3333333333333333, 's4': 0.26666666666666666, 'none': 0.06666666666666667})",0.85733491898956,0.07645289979889637,1.0,1.0,1.0

Along with corsages and doctoral hoods, most graduates,  professors and administrators wore a round yellow sticker that read: ""No cuts! No firings! Defend Queens College.""</p> <p>The stickers were a response to threatened state budget cuts. Faculty and staff members handed out the yellow stickers to the 3,500 graduates and their families. They also distributed letters for people to sign and send to state legislators.</p> <p>Most of the speakers referred to the budget dispute. Carolyn Goodman, the mother of Andrew Goodman, a Queens College student who was killed during the Mississippi Freedom Summer in 1964, received the Queens College President's Medal. Dr. Goodman, who tearfully noted that Andrew would have celebrated his 30th reunion this year, said she had testified at a budget hearing on campus two weeks ago.</p> <p>Although the college presented a solid front at graduation -- even the president, Dr. Allen Lee Sessoms, wore a sticker -- there were less cordial undertones. During the applause after Dr. Sessoms' speech, the faculty section was noticeably silent. Dr. Sessoms had refused to allow the chairwoman of the faculty and staff union, Barbara Bowen, to speak at the main commencement, although she did speak at a later ceremony.</p> <p>One student representative, Jose R. Peralta, referred to the dispute over Ms. Bowen's speech, saying he would speak for her.

97.66666666666667,1,389,"<p>One of the ways the rich are different is that their children are much more likely to attend college. Nearly 80 percent of high-income high school graduates went directly to college in 2004, versus some 60 percent of middle-income graduates and about half of those who are low income. Inadequate financial aid is not the only reason for such disturbing discrepancies. But it's a significant one -- and one that Congress can do something about this year.</p> <p>Currently, low- and moderate-income families get little or nothing from the tax code's two main tuition credits, the Hope credit and the Lifetime Learning credit. They can be worth as much as $2,000 a year per student. But they work by reducing income tax liability, and since the bulk of most lower-income families' taxes are payroll taxes, not income taxes, those families can't benefit.</p> <p>The Senate Finance Committee is now working to produce legislation to improve the education tax breaks. The best reform ideas are in a bill supported by a bipartisan handful of senators. It would give lower-income families a refund when their income tax bill is too low to qualify for a credit and would allow the credit amount to be used for other expenses, like books and supplies. That's very important for students at community colleges and public universities, where tuition is lower and may be covered by other aid, leaving nontuition expenses uncovered.</p> <p>Last year, when he was in the minority, Senator Max Baucus sponsored a bill with many of those improvements. Now, as leader of the Finance Committee, he should work to ensure that they become law.</p> <p>Unfortunately, some senators would prefer to make education tax breaks more generous for higher-income families. Such families are also squeezed. But the squeeze is much worse at lower incomes. Even after aid like federal Pell Grants and subsidized loans, 70 percent of public university students from families with annual incomes between $20,000 and $40,000 had unmet need in 2004, averaging $5,500 a year per student, according to the Department of Education.</p> <p>Senators will either target resources where the need is greatest, or where they're most likely to get votes and campaign contributions.
