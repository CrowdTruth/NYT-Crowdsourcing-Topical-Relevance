In 1959 we fled Fidel Castro's Cuba for the United States, where we started from scratch. It was a modest start with profits guaranteed by no one, and risk, as with all farming, abundant. Today we're proud to employ more than 3,000 Floridians making an average of $31,000 a year.</p> <p>The ''subsidy'' myth: There is no subsidy. United States sugar policy prevents the dumping of foreign sugar, just as its trade policy prevents the dumping of foreign-subsidized cars. In addition, the General Accounting Office report that cites a hidden consumer cost has been discredited by the Department of Agriculture. Sugar is cheaper in the United States than in most other countries.</p> <p>Another myth is that sugar farmers are not cooperating with Everglades restoration efforts. Three years ago sugar farmers joined with the Federal Government on a plan to restore the Everglades.</p> <p>Even as the plan was showing good results, a state ballot issue was proposed, with a multibillion-dollar price tag. The scheme, which included additional sugar taxes, was rejected by Florida voters for good reasons: they wanted further evidence that the proposal was sound, and they thought that it unfairly singled out sugar farmers.</p> <p>Finally, there is the myth that there is a villain and an easy solution. It was the Army Corps of Engineers, acting with the best intentions, that helped divert the natural flow of water in the Everglades. It acted rashly. As a result, today five million people live on and impact what was once the Everglades.</p> <p>Fixing the Everglades is complex, and much restoration is under way. We should give it a chance while looking for better ways to proceed. Perhaps if everyone from growers to environmentalists looked more at reality than myths, progress would come more readily.</p> <p>ALFONSO FANJUL  J.

George Pataki have frightened even fiscal conservatives, many of whom see the cuts as too much, too fast -- and an unfair blow to the poor.</p> <p>CUNY and SUNY have experienced a steady series of cuts in state funding -- often with dramatic consequences. The two systems were forced to impose tuition  increases of $750 last year -- from $2,650 to $3,400 at SUNY and from $2,450 to  $3,200 at CUNY. The higher fees drove out many struggling students, and were partly responsible for a combined enrollment drop of 16,000 in the two systems.</p> <p>Now Mr. Pataki is proposing dramatic cuts and formula changes in the Tuition  Assistance Program, known as TAP, that would make it even harder for low-income  students to attend college. In New York City alone, TAP cuts would cause 50,000  students to lose up to $1,029 each per year -- with the heaviest hit on families earning under $16,000.</p> <p>The SUNY board of trustees, now controlled by Mr. Pataki, has not protested the cuts. But an internal SUNY analysis shows justifiable worry on the front lines. At SUNY Binghamton, for example, 65 percent of the TAP recipients would lose an average of $934 each -- a ruinous sum for poor and lower-middle-class students. At some community colleges, low-income students would lose roughly 60  percent of their state aid. The administration also proposes letting aid increases lag a year behind tuition increases, further pressing poor families.</p> <p>The Pataki administration says the cuts are warranted because New York is overly generous, spending three times as much on tuition assistance as Pennsylvania, Illinois or California. It estimates that, even after the cuts, nearly a third of New York's 300,000 TAP recipients will receive full-tuition scholarships. But tuition is less than half the cost of an actual SUNY or CUNY education.</p> <p>State Education Commissioner Richard P. Mills was on the mark when he argued  against the cuts, saying that the TAP was an investment in New York's future --  and in a more highly skilled work force. That investment is already falling short of what is needed. Despite substantial enrollment increases over the last  decade, higher education aid has grown more slowly in New York than in almost any other state. Before shifting costs onto the shoulders of struggling families, Mr. Pataki needs to look hard for economies elsewhere. The Legislature needs to resolve the TAP debate quickly. Uncertainty over student aid could prompt many New Yorkers not to apply to college at all.</p>",835331,Keep College Open to the Poor,,182,1,,690,Find documents which describe an advantage in hiring potential or increased income for graduates of U.S. colleges.,college education advantage
