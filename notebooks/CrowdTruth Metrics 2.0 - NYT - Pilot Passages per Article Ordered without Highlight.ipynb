    "The unit quality score $UQS(u)$ is computed as the average cosine similarity between all worker vectors for a given input media unit $u$, weighted by the worker quality ($WQS$) and annotation quality ($AQS$).

    "The worker-media unit agreement $WUA(i)$ is the average cosine distance between the annotations of a worker $i$ and all annotations for the media units they have worked on, weighted by the media unit and annotation quality.

Therefore, it is only applicable to closed tasks, where the same annotation set is used for all input media units.
