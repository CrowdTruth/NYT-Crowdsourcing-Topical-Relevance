But an internal SUNY analysis shows justifiable worry on the front lines. At SUNY Binghamton, for example, 65 percent of the TAP recipients would lose an average of $934 each -- a ruinous sum for poor and lower-middle-class students. At some community colleges, low-income students would lose roughly 60  percent of their state aid. The administration also proposes letting aid increases lag a year behind tuition increases, further pressing poor families.</p> <p>The Pataki administration says the cuts are warranted because New York is overly generous, spending three times as much on tuition assistance as Pennsylvania, Illinois or California.

Along with corsages and doctoral hoods, most graduates,  professors and administrators wore a round yellow sticker that read: ""No cuts! No firings! Defend Queens College.""</p> <p>The stickers were a response to threatened state budget cuts. Faculty and staff members handed out the yellow stickers to the 3,500 graduates and their families. They also distributed letters for people to sign and send to state legislators.</p> <p>Most of the speakers referred to the budget dispute. Carolyn Goodman, the mother of Andrew Goodman, a Queens College student who was killed during the Mississippi Freedom Summer in 1964, received the Queens College President's Medal. Dr. Goodman, who tearfully noted that Andrew would have celebrated his 30th reunion this year, said she had testified at a budget hearing on campus two weeks ago.</p> <p>Although the college presented a solid front at graduation -- even the president, Dr. Allen Lee Sessoms, wore a sticker -- there were less cordial undertones. During the applause after Dr. Sessoms' speech, the faculty section was noticeably silent. Dr. Sessoms had refused to allow the chairwoman of the faculty and staff union, Barbara Bowen, to speak at the main commencement, although she did speak at a later ceremony.</p> <p>One student representative, Jose R. Peralta, referred to the dispute over Ms. Bowen's speech, saying he would speak for her. He asked the students to repeat after him:</p> <p>""Whether I live in Park Avenue or Park Slope, my education is my right,"" they said in unison. ""Whether I make $50,000 or $5 an hour, my education is my right. So, Governor Pataki, stop the crime and fund education.""</p> <p>Brooklyn College</p> <p>The chancellor of California State University, Barry Munitz, told more than 1,700 Brooklyn College graduates at their commencement yesterday to vote and to  make sure that they got others to register to vote.</p> <p>Mr. Munitz, a 1963 Brooklyn College graduate, also exhorted the students to embrace change and to be active members of society.</p> <p>Among the colorfully robed swarms of graduates (bachelor's degree recipients  wore lavender; master's degree recipients wore black) were more than 100 alumni  from the class of 1946, all wearing gold robes.</p> <p>""It's a grand feeling to be here today,"" said Sylvia Deutsch, a 1946 alumna who is a former chairwoman of the New York City Planning Commission. She and her husband, Leon, a retired New York State Family Court judge, gave a joint address.</p> <p>They reminded those gathered that the class of 1946 had struggled through the Depression and World War II to build their lives. Then the couple told the students to expect adversity.
