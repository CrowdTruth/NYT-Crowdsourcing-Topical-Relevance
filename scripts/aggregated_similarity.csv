This vividly imagined other world, Ms. Boddy argues, is in itself esthetically and creatively rewarding.

Millions of supports, also known as wrist managers, have been sold. More than a million of the Pro Flex model alone have been sold since 1989, including half amillion this year. The company expects to sell a half million more in 1993. WHY: In 1990 the Bureau of Labor Statistics estimated that of the 46 million Americans using computer keyboards, more than 180,000 suffered from wrist or hand injuries linked to repetitive tasks like typing. The most serious repetitive stress injury, or R.S.I., is carpal tunnel syndrome, a swelling of nerves where they pass through the wrists. That can cause crippling pain, weakness, numbness or tingling in the hands or wrists. Less troubling injuries include a variety of inflammation and swelling problems.",0.0769527921,0.8028576214,0.8418681929999999,0.5794283037,1.0,0.9117583691448644,0.794057562299645,0.0,0.535084370678088,1
350,572210,1,449,2,Health and Computer Terminals,Is it hazardous to the health of individuals to work with computer terminals on a daily basis?,p2,"WHO NEEDS IT?: You, possibly. In this age of the ubiquitous computer keyboard, the average data-entry office worker will flex his wrists about 5,000 times a day. ""They have become occupational athletes,"" said Paula Newman, a spokeswoman for Ergodyne. WHO ELSE?: Actual athletes, like bowlers, bicyclists, tennis players, golfers and softball players, as well as workers involved in tasks like meat-cutting, operating a cash register, dealing cards or working on an assembly line. ""Basically, anyone who is involved with picking, packing or plucking,"" Ms. Newman said. HOW IT WORKS: Wraps around the wrist with Velcro-like fasteners (Ergodyne's name for hook and loop fasteners is Aplix) and across the palm between the thumb and index finger. The device is designed to keep the wrist straight without immobilizing it. Most older wrist supports contained hard plastic splints and sometimes laced up the forearm like a corset. The Pro Flex has flexible steel stays encased in two synthetic materials, Vinaguard and Ultrilure, that give it as much support as a hard wrist support but increased movement and comfort. WHERE TO BUY IT: See the ergonomic experts where you work. Most Pro Flex supports are sold to them in bulk by safety equipment distributors, but they are also available in some hardware stores and home centers under the Safety Maid label. Average cost: $20. FASHION FACTS: Sizes range from X-Small to X-Large, but there are only two color schemes: tan with navy or black with silver. There are no plans for pastel, fluorescent or leather models, although there have been requests. Ergodyne can customize its wrist supports with logos, company colors, reflective tape or employee numbers. THE REST OF THE LINE: Ergodyne sells matching back supports, foot rests, computer keyboard wrist rests, tennis elbow supports, hand exercisers and anti-vibration gloves (for jack-hammer operators).",0.09479208300000001,0.7794596001999999,0.9646196173,0.6415334664,1.0,0.9015587467720375,0.6183728029822128,0.0,0.40872846552535047,1

He certainly showed that he is out of the ordinary when he defied the law and walked across a high wire strung between the towers of the World Trade Center in 1974. He displays his engineering side in ''To Reach the Clouds'' when he discusses the intricacies of covertly transporting his equipment to a tower roof and the all-night project of rigging the cable. He describes his first trip to the United States from Paris after reading about the trade center; recruiting accomplices; nighttime scouting trips through the towers; failed plans; suspicious security guards; his first triumphant steps; and the police and news media attention that bombarded him afterward. At times Petit's whimsy is too much, and his language melodramatic and self-conscious (''I offer to myself, for a throne, the highest tower ever built by man; for a ceremonial carpet, the most savagely gigantic city of the Americas; for my dominion, a tray of seas wetting my forehead; while the folds of my wind-sculpted cape surround me with majestically mortal whirls'').
