Resurrection, the meaninglessness of the flesh, the primacy of the spirit, the conversion from the physical to the heavenly plane are features of several faiths. But the crucial safety brake in most theologies is that the believer himself cannot choose the moment of ascension. Only the central deity can do that.</p> <p>The interesting thing about Branch Davidians, Jonestownsians and now the Heaven's Gaters is not so much their ad hoc mumbo-jumbo. It is instead the centrality of the cult figure who manages to convince the weak and wounded that he or she has acquired the godlike power to set the date and destination of life's last journey.</p>",918882,Gateway to Madness,,,,7,2,,,,325,Describe a cult by name and identify the cult members' activities in their everyday life.,Cult Lifestyles

Excavation will begin on Thursday morning, the police said. But even before that work begins, the death toll already stands at more than 600.</p> <p>Here at the home of an excommunicated priest, Father Dominic Kataribabo, investigators unearthed 74 bodies in the backyard on Monday.

The pit, lined with banana leaves, was just six feet deep and five feet square, and the corpses were packed together in a dense, interlocking heap.</p> <p>Since Feb. 17, at least 654 bodies have been recovered in the wreckage of a cult, the Movement for the Restoration of the Ten Commandments of God, that splintered off from the Roman Catholic Church. The group demanded strict adherence to the Ten Commandments, required members to sell off their possessions and preached that the world would end on Dec. 31, 1999.</p> <p>The police originally suspected mass suicide when more than 300 followers burned to death in a church in the town of Kanungu, less than 50 miles from here.

Mr. Pasqua made no effort to conceal his view that Mr. Juppe was not up to leading the campaign to victory.</p> <p>Mr. Juppe said tonight that he was not campaigning to succeed himself,  but it is widely expected that he would be reappointed to lead a new Conservative Government.</p> <p>The criteria for the common currency, including a strict limit on budget deficits, were set by the late President Francois Mitterrand, a Socialist, and other European leaders at a meeting in Maastricht, the Netherlands, at the end of 1991.</p> <p>But the leader of the Socialist opposition, Lionel Jospin, distanced his party from its former leader's position on the common currency in an interview published in today's Le Journal du Dimanche.</p> <p>''If fulfilling the Maastricht criteria requires imposing still another austerity cure, the country simply can't accept it, economically and socially,'' he said.</p> <p>In a campaign interview on French national television tonight, Mr. Juppe said, ''If the Maastricht criteria didn't exist, we'd have to do the same thing anyway. The French economy is asphyxiated by public expenses and taxes.''</p> <p>But he said that further austerity measures would not be required to shake France out of the doldrums of double-digit unemployment, now at 12.8 percent.</p> <p>''When growth returns, and everybody is predicting growth of 3 percent in 1998, that will permit us to reduce taxes and deficits,'' he said.</p> <p>A common currency, administered by an independent European central bank, would take many of these decisions out of national hands, the main reason why so many Conservatives in Britain oppose introducing the euro there.</p> <p>Mr. Mitterrand was among the principal architects of the treaty, and Mr. Jospin's Socialists campaigned for its acceptance in a hotly contested referendum in 1992.</p> <p>According to the public opinion polls, they do not stand to win a majority in the new 577-seat French legislature, but might be able to form a Government with the Communists if there were a leftward surge in the vote.

On the far right, Jean-Marie Le Pen's National Front party is also against the euro, which he sees as an unacceptable surrender of French national sovereignty to European Union bureaucrats.</p> <p>So, Mr. Juppe argued, the only manageable electoral outcome was a conservative majority to pull Europe in the same direction as France's conservative President as the century ends.

Photographs show men and women with swollen lash marks across their backs and chests. Opposition leaders report that more than 1,000 people have fled their homes and that more than 500 people have been arrested.</p> <p>The police confirmed that they had arrested hundreds, adding that those detained had incited violence. Some of them, the police said, burned buses and cars. The police officials denied accusations of brutality.</p> <p>Human rights groups, however, say most of those arrested are leaders and supporters of Zimbabwe's main opposition party, the Movement for Democratic Change. The prisoners, human rights officials say, are often beaten and detained in their homes.</p> <p>The deepening tensions followed a two-day strike by the opposition that halted most business and industry in Zimbabwe. The action was considered the largest public protest against Mr. Mugabe, 79, since he was re-elected last year in a contest that was marred by charges of fraud and intimidation.</p> <p>Political analysts and opposition leaders issued forecasts for more political storms ahead. In a speech last Friday, Mr. Mugabe boasted that he could be a ''black Hitler, tenfold.''</p> <p>The State Department has called on the Zimbabwe government to ''cease its campaign of violent repression,'' and to bring to justice the perpetrators of ''serious and widespread human rights abuses.''</p> <p>South African leaders, long advocates of what they call ''quiet diplomacy'' with Zimbabwe, began on Wednesday to turn up the volume, with expressions of concern by President Thabo Mbeki of South Africa to Parliament. A South African diplomat in Harare said President Mbeki had ordered them to ''get to the bottom of the accusations and report back.''</p> <p>Amnesty International, in a report on Friday, issued a warning that said: ''The alarming escalation in political violence is a clear indication that the Zimbabwe authorities are determined to suppress dissent by any means necessary, regardless of the terrible consequences. We look upon the next 10 days with fear.''</p> <p>On Sunday, voters in two important townships currently controlled by the opposition are supposed to go to the polls to elect new representatives to the Zimbabwean Parliament.</p> <p>In a news conference today in Harare, opposition leaders showed reporters copies of the government's voter rolls, and said that dozens of people on the lists did not exist. Government officials dismissed those charges.</p> <p>Monday will mark the deadline set by the opposition for Mr. Mugabe to accept and begin addressing a list of 15 demands, including disbanding government militias, restoring freedom of the press and releasing all political prisoners.</p> <p>Mr. Mugabe, who has governed Zimbabwe since the end of white-minority rule more than 20 years ago, played down the impact of the strike and dismissed his opponents' demands, saying he would not obey ''pathetic puppets'' of the West.</p> <p>He also ordered security forces to crack down on those using violence against the government, accusing the opposition of employing mob aggression under the guise of defending human rights.</p> <p>The oppositon, emboldened by the success of its two-day strike, has promised ''mass action,'' against Mr. Mugabe. Morgan Tsvangirai, leader of the Movement for Democratic Change, said the violence by soldiers and militia had deepened the country's ''crisis of governance.''</p> <p>''No amount of brutality and arrests will discourage people from engaging in an agenda they have determined whose time has come,'' said Mr. Tsvangirai, who is currently on trial on charges of treason.

Regulations' Cost</p> <p>Labor and business officials have estimated that the cost of compliance could run from as little as $200 per work station to several thousand dollars per work station.</p> <p>The ordinance is intended to prevent muscle and eye fatigue and wrist inflammations resulting from prolonged use of computer terminals.</p> <p>Similar attempts in other states and cities to regulate the use of computer terminals have been defeated by opposition in business. A law was enacted in Suffolk County, L.I., in 1988, but it was struck down by a state court, which ruled that such regulation was the province of state or Federal governments. The decision is under appeal.</p> <p>Mayor Agnos said today he was confident there would be no litigation to challenge San Francisco's law. But he also called for statewide regulations so San Francisco businesses would not be at a disadvantage.</p> <p>The California Division of Occupational Safety and Health has said it would propose regulation of the terminals. If enacted, state regulations probably would preempt the San Francisco law.</p>",411417,San Francisco's Computer Bill Becomes Law,,,,98,2,,,,350,Is it hazardous to the health of individuals to work with computer terminals on a daily basis?,Health and Computer Terminals

Less troubling injuries include a variety of inflammation and swelling problems.</p> <p>WHO NEEDS IT?: You, possibly. In this age of the ubiquitous computer keyboard, the average data-entry office worker will flex his wrists about 5,000 times a day. ""They have become occupational athletes,"" said Paula Newman, a spokeswoman for Ergodyne. WHO ELSE?: Actual athletes, like bowlers, bicyclists, tennis players, golfers and softball players, as well as workers involved in tasks like meat-cutting, operating a cash register, dealing cards or working on an assembly line. ""Basically, anyone who is involved with picking, packing or plucking,"" Ms. Newman said. HOW IT WORKS: Wraps around the wrist with Velcro-like fasteners (Ergodyne's name for hook and loop fasteners is Aplix) and across the palm between the thumb and index finger. The device is designed to keep the wrist straight without immobilizing it. Most older wrist supports contained hard plastic splints and sometimes laced up the forearm like a corset. The Pro Flex has flexible steel stays encased in two synthetic materials, Vinaguard and Ultrilure, that give it as much support as a hard wrist support but increased movement and comfort. WHERE TO BUY IT: See the ergonomic experts where you work. Most Pro Flex supports are sold to them in bulk by safety equipment distributors, but they are also available in some hardware stores and home centers under the Safety Maid label. Average cost: $20. FASHION FACTS: Sizes range from X-Small to X-Large, but there are only two color schemes: tan with navy or black with silver. There are no plans for pastel, fluorescent or leather models, although there have been requests.

Quite the contrary, those summers gave me the wherewithal to grab a low spot on the totem pole of bourgeois life, a spot to which I have clung desperately ever since.</p> <p>No, I think of the guillotine because those summers and the years that followed taught me something about the changing nature of income inequality and class resentment. Back in 1978, when I made off with an Ivy League diploma, my first job paid less than I had been making opening doors and helping old ladies with their packages. Worse yet, it took me four years of full-time work before my white-collar wages exceeded what I would have earned in uniform back on East 69th Street. Even at that point, however, I was still in the hole. Think of all those semesters of forgone earnings. Think of the tuition, room, board and bookstore expenses. And think about the cost of all that capital.</p> <p>I have to acknowledge that in those days, I resented the wages of Teamsters and sanitation workers almost as much as I did hereditary wealth. Much has been written lately about the enormous earnings advantage conferred by a college education, but what's striking to me is that this advantage was once so scant. Thirty years ago, in fact, the economist Richard Freeman published a book called ''The Over-educated American,'' and although I was too young and stupid to realize it, I was one.</p> <p>It's true that I chose a line of work -- newspapers -- that is notorious for low entry-level wages, but the broader data bear me out. In 1978, men with a bachelor's degree had an estimated wage premium of just 21 percent over men who were high school graduates, according to ''The State of Working America 2004-2005'' by Lawrence Mishel, Jared Bernstein and Sylvia Allegretto.</p> <p>But in my case, even that modest premium was illusory. My new white-collar job required a car and crazy hours; there was little overtime pay. The progressive tax system probably further eroded the college premium, because higher earnings were subject to higher levies.</p> <p>In 2003, the most recent year for which the book contained data, the male college wage differential was 41.5 percent -- practically double what it was when I started out. Although it's possible that my current modest prosperity is entirely a result of good looks (that would account for why it's so modest), chances are that education played a big role in making me better off financially than the doormen among whom I once worked.</p> <p>In coming years, the earnings premium for educated Americans will probably increase because of factors like new technology, outsourcing, large numbers of unskilled immigrants and the tendency of the educated to marry one another. Within the economic arena, I doubt that much can be done about this differential.</p> <p>Today, it's doubtful that many college graduates would envy the pay and benefits of most blue-collar workers. Those who inherit money, meanwhile, can't be blamed for their own dumb luck. So most of us direct our class-based ire at what might be called the new earnings aristocracy. Consider Sanford I. Weill, the former Citigroup chairman, who made nearly $1 billion on the job yet still departs with an annual pension exceeding $1 million -- as well as medical and dental insurance. Or how about William W. McGuire, the chief executive of the UnitedHealth Group, who is reported by The Wall Street Journal to have $1.6 billion in unrealized gains on stock options when workers and employers are battling over who will pay for soaring medical premiums?</p> <p>THAT'S where the guillotine comes in. I'm not expecting anything like the French Revolution, of course. The guillotine I'm talking about is more figurative than literal. It could take the form of punitive marginal tax rates, new trade barriers or excessive regulation of private enterprise -- changes that will make everyone poorer.</p> <p>If those at the top of the heap are really so smart, they should start advocating some orderly increase in redistribution -- at the very least, in the form of national health coverage. They should do this if only to maintain social peace -- to prevent the less fortunate, in other words, from losing their heads. Because, if that happens, the rich may lose theirs as well.</p> <p>ON THE CONTRARY Daniel Akst is a journalist and novelist who writes often about business.

But George Bush's image-makers chose not to press the rhetorical point in his Presidential campaign, and for good reason.</p> <p>Young, male, blue-collar workers, part of the demographic coalition that has given Republicans a big leg up on the White House in recent decades, suffered devastating financial setbacks during the 1980's. While the real earnings of 25- to 34-year-old men who graduated college rose by 9 percent from 1979 to 1987, the earnings of high school dropouts fell 15 percent. High school graduates did not do much better, absorbing a 9 percent cut.</p> <p>Few economists are inclined to blame Republicans, or anyone else, for the way the chips fall in a free market: That would legitimize government tinkering with market-determined wages in order to right social wrongs.

But now the Army, along with other branches of the armed services, is facing a serious recruiting gap that is forcing it to rethink its hiring practices and marketing strategy. The proposed changes in tactics outlined in an article in Monday's Times seem like a good start on what is likely to be a long and difficult effort to turn things around. As a collateral benefit, these changes may help society as well.</p> <p>Officials at the Pentagon offer several reasons for the declining lack of interest in military service. One is purely statistical. The pool of young men and women between the ages of 18 and 22, the optimum age for recruits, has shrunk to about 21 million, down 5 million from the 1980 level. Meanwhile, a robust economy has created abundant job opportunities for those who might otherwise be interested in enlisting, while making it financially feasible for more young people to attend college.</p> <p>There may also be more amorphous influences at work. Louis Caldera, the Secretary of the Army, notes that many of the parents of the present generation of recruits came of age after the draft ended in 1973, and thus have no tradition of military service to pass along to their offspring. Representative Steve Buyer, an Indiana Republican who heads the House subcommittee on military personnel, believes that the armed forces have never codified their basic mission since the end of the cold war and, under President Clinton, have begun to resemble an international fire brigade with poorly defined, helter-skelter responsibilities that might best be left to regional powers.</p> <p>Whatever the reason, the numbers are not good. When the fiscal year ends tomorrow, the Army will fall short of its goal for the second year in a row, signing up 7,000 fewer enlistees than the 74,500 it needs to maintain its force at current levels. The Air Force is expected to miss its target by a lesser amount and the Navy will just squeak by. Only the Marine Corps has kept pace. Like all the services, the Army has increased its advertising, raised its ''signing bonuses'' and increased its contribution to a recruit's post-military college tuition from $40,000 to $50,000.

In a similar vein, the Army will try to sign up students who have started college but dropped out.</p> <p>In effect, the Army will increasingly be seeking its recruits among dropouts of one sort or another, as long as they possess or can be persuaded to obtain minimal credentials. This strategy could yield a double benefit. It could not only help the Army deal with its manpower problems but also give a new sense of direction to many thousands of young people who might otherwise wind up on the streets, unemployed or in dead-end service jobs.</p>",1141427,Shoring Up the Volunteer Army,,,,189,0,,,,690,Find documents which describe an advantage in hiring potential or increased income for graduates of U.S. colleges.,college education advantage

Yet to the dismay of officials in charge of veterans' affairs, a third of veterans never take advantage of their education benefits -- although they have paid out money for the purpose of receiving them.</p> <p>That fact may surprise most Americans, but the free education benefits set aside for former soldiers are not entirely free. Unless you look very carefully through your enlistment papers and sign away future benefits, the government will take out $100 a month during the first year of service. Consider it a down payment for benefits to come.</p> <p>After three years of service, though, the benefits are worth a lot more than that initial investment. Veterans can get more than $36,000 for tuition, books, living expenses and most anything else that might come up, provided the money is used within 10 years.</p> <p>''We've still got work to do in understanding why people are paying into a program and then not availing themselves of its use,'' says Dennis B.

Yet to the dismay of officials in charge of veterans' affairs, a third of veterans never take advantage of their education benefits -- although they have paid out money for the purpose of receiving them.</p> <p>That fact may surprise most Americans, but the free education benefits set aside for former soldiers are not entirely free. Unless you look very carefully through your enlistment papers and sign away future benefits, the government will take out $100 a month during the first year of service. Consider it a down payment for benefits to come.</p> <p>After three years of service, though, the benefits are worth a lot more than that initial investment. Veterans can get more than $36,000 for tuition, books, living expenses and most anything else that might come up, provided the money is used within 10 years.</p> <p>''We've still got work to do in understanding why people are paying into a program and then not availing themselves of its use,'' says Dennis B. Douglass, deputy director for education service at the Department of Veterans Affairs. ''Some of them are not only unaware that these benefits expire, but they are not even aware of the benefits available to them.''</p> <p>Today's participation rates are not exactly poor by historical standards. According to V.A. statistics, about half of eligible World War II veterans, or 7.8 million, took advantage of the education benefits under the first G.I. Bill of Rights. It was this bill that helped make higher education such an integral part of society.</p> <p>The enthusiasm of veterans of the Korean War era slipped a little, with about 4 in 10 using their education benefits. But even so, no less than 2.4 million of those veterans went to college on the government's dime.</p> <p>By the end of the Vietnam War, more veterans than ever were going to school under the G.I. Bill, about 8.2 million. But since the late 1970's only about two million have taken advantage of the benefits. Still, that's almost 7 in 10 veterans, a ratio that is only slightly lower than during the Vietnam era because of the overall decline in recent veterans.</p> <p>To stimulate more interest, the government has been pushing to remind soon-to-be veterans that money for college or training awaits them after discharge and that the benefits will expire.

Ms. Craig said she still pays special attention to the eight students on her ''roster,'' but the desks of all 34 students are intermingled, and the distinction is ignored when breaking into small groups for reading and language, spelling, math and science, based on level of skill.</p> <p>In each subject, Ms. Spagnola said, some special students are at higher levels than some mainstream classmates.</p> <p>''It was a world of difference,'' Ms. Spagnola said.

Previously this population had little, if any, vocational options other than sheltered workshops. Mr. McCarthy, while attesting to the benefits of supportive employment, raised many unresolved issues; eligibility, responsibility for implementation of job trainers and the acquisition of social skills that are necessary in order for mentally handicapped people to be successful in their employment situations.</p> <p>The Education for All Handicapped Children Act, Public Law 94-142, guarantees every handicapped child ''a free and appropriate education.'' What is a more appropriate education for a moderately mentally handicapped student than to learn those social and vocational skills necessary to enable him/her meaningful employment while living within the community?</p> <p>The student's school district should be the responsible party in facilitating this concept through the youngster's Individual Educational Plan. There should be no predetermined age at which this training starts. Districts should not be allowed to only begin this process when a student reaches late teens. (How is this individualized?) Presently, some districts have created segregated, simulated work environments. Very often students are relegated to these prevocational classes for up to five years before any real job situations occur. Students in these programs have no opportunity for the necessary acquisition of social skills because there is no contact with the mainstream population.</p> <p>As the parent of one such handicapped child, I have sought to enlighten my district as to my daughter's needs and its obligation. (Unfortunately this has to be accomplished through a long administrative hearing that will ultimately lead to Federal court.)

He said the proposal had been made to Mr. Eliasson, who this week ended 16 days of shuttle diplomacy and left for New York after four visits each to Teheran and Baghdad.</p> <p>There was no word, however, of a response from Baghdad to the new Iranian terms, and thus no guarantee that the hostile neighbors would be able to unlock the stalemate since the August 1988 cease-fire stilled eight years of war that claimed a million lives.</p> <p>The Iranian and Iraqi statements were the first sign of movement in Mr. Eliasson's mediation effort.</p> <p>Foreign Minister Velayati told Mr. Eliasson that Iran's shift was ''a move in good will and a bid to help break the present artificial impasse, which benefits no one,'' the Iranian agency said. Concern Over P.O.W.'s</p> <p>''This, we hope, would pave the way for peace and relieve the sufferings of the displaced citizens of areas under Iraqi occupations as well as the P.O.W.'s in the two countries,'' Mr. Velayati was quoted as saying. He did not refer to the Iraqi proposal for a joint committee, made two days after he made public Iran's shift.</p> <p>According to Red Cross figures, Iraq holds 18,000 registered Iranian prisoners and between 22,000 and 27,000 other Iranians at other unregistered camps. Iran holds more than 50,000 registered Iraqi prisoners and a 10,000 to 20,000 other unregistered prisoners, according to Red Cross estimates.</p> <p>Their plight has been a focus of international concern since the end of the fighting and the stalemate in the United Nations-sponsored negotiations. About 400 prisoners have been freed, most of them disabled or old, since the cease-fire, but the further exchange of captives was halted after Iran and Iraq traded accusations of bad faith.</p> <p>Mr. Eliasson was reported to have told Iranian officials that he hoped the Iranian and Iraqi Foreign Ministers would meet next month under the auspices of Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar.</p> <p>After a string of Iraqi victories, the two sides stopped fighting last year under a United Nations resolution that included demands for the establishment of a committee to decide who started the war and for negotiations to discuss other matters.

It passed unanimously after the country's usual defenders, including Russia and China, distanced themselves from Iran.</p> <p>The resolution also criticizes Iran for not explaining how several sites in the country were contaminated with highly enriched uranium. And it contends that the country hampered the efforts of inspectors to explore the suspect facilities.</p> <p>The episode is the latest in a nearly two-year confrontation in which the agency's frustrations with Iraq are beginning to show. The director of the agency, Mohamed ElBaradei, said the statement ''calls in very explicit terms on Iran to accelerate its cooperation.'' He said it must clear up the lingering questions within ''the next few months.''</p> <p>Iran defiantly rejected the pressure. A senior Iranian diplomat, Amir Zamaninia, warned that Tehran would instead reconsider ''voluntary confidence-building measures,'' which include a pledge to suspend the enrichment of uranium, a preliminary step in producing a nuclear device.</p> <p>Iran's chief delegate here, Hossein Mousavian, was more conciliatory, saying his government would continue to work with the agency and would abide by its existing agreements.</p> <p>The United States welcomed the resolution, but left little doubt that it would have preferred a stiffer response. The American ambassador to the agency, Kenneth C. Brill, asked the board to consider whether more urgent steps were needed to compel Iran to cooperate.</p> <p>''The passage of time is not a neutral factor in proliferation cases,'' Mr. Brill said in a statement.</p> <p>The United States lobbied unsuccessfully for the resolution to include a deadline for Iran to show a more compliant attitude. Mr. Brill said Washington still believed that the matter should be referred to the United Nations Security Council, where Iran could face sanctions.</p> <p>The next step in the showdown could come soon, as the agency looks into reports that Iran may have conducted nuclear activity on an undeclared site next to a military facility near Tehran.

Under the main agreement, approved at the 1992 Earth Summit here, Brazil was to provide just 10 percent of the $250 million.</p> <p>The pilot program, which pays for surveying the vast rain forest, has been the principal vehicle for marking off 40,000 square miles for Indian reservations.</p> <p>Surveying is seen as the first step toward protecting the Amazon from destruction by ranchers, loggers, farmers and miners.</p> <p>The Group of Seven money was also earmarked for promoting sustainable development, controlling deforestation and other objectives.</p> <p>In addition, the money would have helped pay for setting aside 10 percent of the rain forest, or 240,000 square miles, as national parks and ecologically protected areas. Amid much fanfare, Brazil's President, Fernando Henrique Cardoso, pledged to establish the protected areas on a visit to New York last April.</p> <p>Covering an area half as big as the continental United States, the Amazon is a lush laboratory of plants, animals and bacteria that contains more than 20 percent of the world's fresh water supply. Throughout much of the decade, as other countries criticized Brazil for failing to protect the rain forest, the Government insisted that wealthy nations pay to map it and to protect its resources. Officials also contended that the scale of the program was insufficient to the task.</p> <p>But environmentalists say that even that modest effort is now in jeopardy. Under pressure to rein in the budget deficit, Brazilian Government officials have slashed spending across the board. A recent agreement with the International Monetary Fund, which is heading a $41.3 billion standby loan for Brazil, reduces Government spending on environmental programs by two-thirds.</p> <p>Under the pilot program, the Brazilian Government provides matching funds and manpower to administer the Group of Seven grant. The Government's revised budget, made public in November, cuts the amount Brazil can expect to get from the group to $6.4 million from more than $61 million.</p> <p>''It is arguably a far more irrational and perverse consequence of the I.M.F. agreement than even the harshest critics of the I.M.F. could have imagined,'' said Stephan Schwartzman, a senior scientist at the Washington-based Environmental Defense Fund.</p> <p>Acre in western Brazil, one of the nine states covered by the rain forest, had developed a three-year program counting on some $5 million of the Group of Seven money to survey and zone its forest. Ninety percent of the cost is being underwritten by the group.</p> <p>''When it was all under way and ready to move forward -- boom -- the cuts came,'' said Maria Janet Santos, who is coordinating zoning for Acre's environmental protection agency.

A coalition of ranchers and industrialists managed to strip the bill of some of its toughest provisions, and is trying to persuade Mr. Cardoso to veto the  important measures that remain. Before doing so, he should think carefully about a report issued last week by the Brazilian National Space Research Institute, which found that deforestation in Brazil's Amazon is growing alarmingly.</p> <p>Brazil has good laws on the books protecting the Amazon but no legal power to enforce them. The environmental agency can levy only absurdly small fines and collects less than 10 percent of them. The legislation passed last week to correct this has been sitting in Congress for seven years.</p> <p>At the top of the list of measures Mr. Cardoso should preserve is a requirement that companies pay the cost of cleaning up environmental damage they caused, even if the Government cannot prove the damage was intentional. Mr. Cardoso should also save a provision that prohibits proven polluters from getting Government contracts or bidding on Government loans for several years, and another measure setting daily fines for companies that refuse to clean up their damage.</p> <p>Enforcement of environmental laws is particularly crucial given the evidence that damage to the Amazon is rapidly worsening. This contributes to global warming and destroys a forest that houses the most diverse group of plants and animals in the world. The new report, which uses satellite data, found that clear-cutting has been rising at a rapid rate. The 1995-96 burning season saw 7,000 square miles destroyed, almost double the annual deforestation that took place four years earlier.</p> <p>The Amazon suffers from other damage not extensive enough to show up in satellite pictures, such as selective logging, fires and drying. A recent report by Brazil's Congress found that the total area affected annually is more than 22,000 square miles.  Another study, by the Woods Hole Research Institute in Massachusetts, found that cutting and burning have dried out the forest to the point that it could burn out of control. Brazil's deforestation is likely to rise as Asian logging companies move deeper into the Amazon.

A coalition of ranchers and industrialists managed to strip the bill of some of its toughest provisions, and is trying to persuade Mr. Cardoso to veto the  important measures that remain. Before doing so, he should think carefully about a report issued last week by the Brazilian National Space Research Institute, which found that deforestation in Brazil's Amazon is growing alarmingly.</p> <p>Brazil has good laws on the books protecting the Amazon but no legal power to enforce them. The environmental agency can levy only absurdly small fines and collects less than 10 percent of them. The legislation passed last week to correct this has been sitting in Congress for seven years.</p> <p>At the top of the list of measures Mr. Cardoso should preserve is a requirement that companies pay the cost of cleaning up environmental damage they caused, even if the Government cannot prove the damage was intentional. Mr. Cardoso should also save a provision that prohibits proven polluters from getting Government contracts or bidding on Government loans for several years, and another measure setting daily fines for companies that refuse to clean up their damage.</p> <p>Enforcement of environmental laws is particularly crucial given the evidence that damage to the Amazon is rapidly worsening. This contributes to global warming and destroys a forest that houses the most diverse group of plants and animals in the world. The new report, which uses satellite data, found that clear-cutting has been rising at a rapid rate. The 1995-96 burning season saw 7,000 square miles destroyed, almost double the annual deforestation that took place four years earlier.</p> <p>The Amazon suffers from other damage not extensive enough to show up in satellite pictures, such as selective logging, fires and drying. A recent report by Brazil's Congress found that the total area affected annually is more than 22,000 square miles.  Another study, by the Woods Hole Research Institute in Massachusetts, found that cutting and burning have dried out the forest to the point that it could burn out of control. Brazil's deforestation is likely to rise as Asian logging companies move deeper into the Amazon. Mr. Cardoso must refrain from further weakening an already weak bill.</p>",992405,Half-Measures to Protect the Amazon,,,,280,0,,,,400,What measures are being taken by local South American authorities to preserve the Amazon tropical rain forest?,Amazon rain forest

The extensive burning of Amazonia adds greatly to the burden of carbon dioxide, cause of the feared greenhouse warming of the earth's atmosphere. Because aid can be so highly leveraged through debt exchange, the forests are cheap to save.</p> <p>As for Brazil, it would lighten its foreign debt burden by helping to save its own natural heritage. The clearer view of Brazilian interests comes from Mr. Sarney's Foreign Minister, not his generals.</p>",220124,Brazil's Debt Can Save the Amazon,,,,282,0,,,,400,What measures are being taken by local South American authorities to preserve the Amazon tropical rain forest?,Amazon rain forest
